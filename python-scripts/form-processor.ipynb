    "In this Notebook, we shall be looking into utilizing the [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/) API to explore the SEC filings of a company. We shall be using the python library python-edgar to access the API. Be careful, the API is limited to 10 requests per second or smth, idk. If a black SUV shows up out in the open, it's probably because you're doing something wrong.\n",

    "- Scrape Data from the company's History since inception\n",

    "- Use the data to get the company's current assets, liabilities, and equity\n",
    "- Generate SaaS Metrics\n",

    "#### What is a 10-K Form?\n",
    "A Form 10-K is an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that gives a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance. Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEC requires this report to keep investors aware of a company's financial condition and to allow them to have enough information before they buy or sell shares in the corporation, or before investing in the firmâ€™s corporate bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why we need 10-K Forms?\n",
    "The SEC mandates that all public companies file regular 10-Ks to keep investors aware of a company's financial condition and to allow them to have enough information before they buy or sell securities issued by that company. The 10-K can appear overly complex at first glance, complete with tables full of data and figures. However, it is because it is so comprehensive that this filing is key for investors to get a handle on a company's financial position and prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Form 10-K is comprised of several parts. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Business summary:** This describes the company's operations. It would include information about business segments, products and services, subsidiaries, markets, regulatory issues, research and development, competition, and employees, among other details.\n",
    "- **Management Discussion and Analysis:** This section allows the company to explain its operations and financial results for the past year.\n",
    "- **Financial statements:** The financial statements would include the company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.\n",
    "- **Additional sections:** Additional sections may discuss the company's management team and legal proceedings.\n"
