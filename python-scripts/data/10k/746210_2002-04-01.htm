          PART I

Item 1.  Business

Overview

Wire One Technologies,  Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was formed
in May  2000  by  the  merger  of  All  Communications  Corporation  ("ACC"),  a
value-added  integrator  of video,  voice and network  communications  solutions
since 1991, into View Tech, Inc.  ("VTI"),  a provider of video,  voice and data
communications equipment and services since 1992.

Wire One is a leading single source provider of video  communications  solutions
that  encompass the entire video  communications  value chain.  We are a leading
integrator for major video communications equipment manufacturers, including the
number one market share leader,  Polycom,  Inc.  ("Polycom"),  which, across its
brands,  accounts for over 50% of the installed  videoconferencing  endpoints in
the United States, as well as Cisco Systems,  RADVision and others.  Our current
customer  base  includes  over  3,000   companies  with   approximately   16,000
videoconferencing  endpoints.  We also operate our  Glowpoint  network  service,
which provides our customers with two-way video communications with high quality
of service. With Glowpoint,  which we believe to be the first network to provide
such  communications by utilizing a dedicated  Internet Protocol ("IP") backbone
and broadband  access,  we offer our customers a single point of contact for all
their video communications requirements.

Industry Overview

In today's fast-paced business  environment,  many companies seek more efficient
and cost effective ways to communicate  with an  increasingly  mobile and widely
distributed  network of employees,  customers,  suppliers  and  partners.  Video
communications  technology enables two or more parties in different locations to
use audio and video to communicate  simultaneously in real time. Moreover, video
provides  an  effective  means of  communication  that  offers  the  benefit  of
face-to-face  interaction  when  participants  are  unable  to meet in a  common
location. The video communications market is a large and rapidly growing market.

Historically,  video communications involved  point-to-point  communication from
designated rooms equipped with large, expensive equipment.  Users were forced to
tolerate cumbersome set-up procedures,  which often required the assistance of a
trained technician.  Moreover, bandwidth constraints and room availability often
limited the functionality, usability and reliability of these systems.

Video Communications Evolution

In recent  years,  video  equipment  manufacturers  have been  building  smaller
devices and units for use with personal  computers and also adopted standards to
help improve  compatibility and user acceptance.  Many of the older room systems
have been replaced as most users migrated to video communications  systems based
upon Integrated Services Digital Network ("ISDN")  standards.  Although superior
to earlier  technologies,  ISDN still has several  shortcomings,  including high
transmission  costs and poor quality of service  ("QoS"),  due  primarily to the
fact that ISDN is fundamentally a narrowband technology. We believe that the low
quality and high cost of video  communications using ISDN has impeded the growth
of the video  communications  market.  More recently,  the development of IP has
promised  new  standards  for  broadband  communications,  and the  industry has
accordingly adopted IP-standards-based  technologies that provide guaranteed QoS
and  lower   transmission   costs  than  ISDN.  The  ability  to  perform  video
communications  over IP is expected to increase  user  adoption and to help make
two-way video communications  widespread in the enterprise and, ultimately,  the
consumer  markets.

           IP Market Opportunity

IP-based Video Communications

While many business users have private networks that could theoretically support
IP  video  communications,  most  are  reluctant  to run a video  communications
application  over the same networks that also support  enterprise data and other
applications.  Among other concerns, the video communications  application would
be required to share bandwidth with data applications  (for example,  e-mail and
file  transfers)  on  the  common  network.  Allocating  enough  bandwidth  in a
corporate   local  area  network   ("LAN")  or  intranet  to  handle   real-time
transmission  of sounds  and images in  addition  to such data  applications  is
difficult and can create congestion that impedes overall network performance. In
addition,  most businesses already find it difficult to effectively maintain and
manage existing  applications due to the shortage of information  technology and
network  personnel.  As a result,  businesses  increasingly  require a  solution
employing a network  dedicated  to video,  which  enables  them to manage  video
communications   isolated   from   their   other   applications   and   existing
communications infrastructure.

An effective  video  network  must also be easily  scalable in much the same way
that a  company  can  simply  add  more  phone  lines as its  employee  base and
operations grow.  Moreover,  widespread adoption by both enterprise and consumer
users  requires  a  video   communications   solution  that  provides  the  same
reliability  as  public  telephone  service.  We  believe  that  there  exists a
significant  opportunity  to provide an IP-based video  communications  solution
that is as scalable, dependable and, ultimately, commonplace as voice telephony.

Products And Services

We are a single  source  provider of video  products  and  services  that assist
customers with systems procurement and integration,  installation, operation and
maintenance of their video communications systems and requirements. We offer our
customers  video  communications  products  from leading  manufacturers  such as
Polycom (which  distributes  products  under the Polycom,  PictureTel and Accord
brands, among others), Cisco Systems and RADVision,  and provide a comprehensive
suite of video  and  data  services  including  integration,  bridging,  on-site
technical assistance, customized training, engineering and maintenance.

Glowpoint

Our Glowpoint network provides customers with a high-quality  platform for video
communications  over IP and related  applications.  The Glowpoint service offers
subscribers   substantially   reduced  transmission  costs  and  superior  video
communications  quality,  remote management of all  videoconferencing  endpoints
utilizing  simple network  management  protocol  ("SNMP"),  gateway  services to
ISDN-based video communications equipment, video streaming and store-and-forward
applications from our network operations center ("NOC").

To  provide  our  Glowpoint  service,   we  have  contracted  with  MCI/WorldCom
Communications  ("WorldCom") and Exodus Communications  ("Exodus") for access to
their IP backbone  network and co-location  facilities.  We have contracted with
WorldCom,  Covad Communications  ("Covad") and others, and plan to contract with
additional  broadband access  providers,  for dedicated  broadband access to the
Glowpoint  network using either digital  subscriber lines ("DSL"),  or dedicated
1.5 Mbps ("T1") or 45 Mbps ("T3")  lines.  Leading IP video  communications  and
video  networking  equipment  suppliers,  including  Polycom,  Cisco Systems and
RADVision,  have already  announced that their products will be compatible  with
Glowpoint.

Video Communications And Data Products

We market and sell a full range of video, audio and data products and systems on
a world-wide basis from Polycom, VCON  Telecommunications,  Ltd. ("VCON"),  Sony
Electronics, Inc., Gentner Communications,  Inc. and Extron Electronics, Inc. We
also distribute data products from companies such as Adtran,  Lucent, Initia and
RADVision to provide our customers with remote access into LANs, permitting them
to acquire  bandwidth on demand and to  digitally  transmit  data.  We configure
single- or multi-vendor video and data conferencing platforms for our clients



                                      -2-
           <page>
            and integrate  systems and components into a complete  solution designed to suit
each customer's particular communications requirements.

Video Communications Services

We offer our customers the  convenience of single vendor  sourcing for virtually
all aspects of their video communications requirements.  In addition, we provide
consulting  services that include an  assessment of customer  needs and existing
communications equipment.

After  designing  a  customer's  video   communications   solution,   which  may
incorporate custom elements designed by our audio-visual integration department,
we deliver,  install and test the communications  equipment.  When the system is
functional,  we provide  training to all levels of our customer's  organization,
including   executives,    managers,    management   information   systems   and
data-processing   administrators   and  technical   staff.   Training   includes
instruction in system operation,  as well as the planning and  administration of
meetings.  By means of thorough  training,  we help to ensure that our customers
understand  the  functionality  of  their  systems  and are  able to  apply  the
technology effectively.

Our OneCare  service  covers a  customer's  entire video  communications  system
deployment for a fixed fee.  OneCare  encompasses  installation  and maintenance
service products that provide comprehensive  customer support after the sale and
help  ensure  that  our  customers   experience   reliable,   effortless   video
communications.  Our installation service places minimal demands on a customer's
time  and  resources.   Our  maintenance   service  provides  technical  support
representatives  and  engineers,  a  help  desk  offering  24x7  responsiveness,
nationwide on-site diagnostic repair and replacement service, nationwide network
trouble coordination and a video test facility.

We also provide advanced telecommunications  consulting and engineering services
through our ProServices department.  Our engineers have in-depth experience with
networks,  microprocessors,  software development and IT management,  as well as
the  design,  deployment  and repair of video  telecommunications  products  and
technology.  Our  engineers  use this  experience  to provide  expert advice and
assistance in evaluating  and deploying the  appropriate  visual  communications
technology to meet a customer's  project goals and  objectives.  These  services
include application consulting and network design,  laboratory testing,  product
application and industry research, and technology trial assistance.

We also sell  multi-point  video and audio bridging  services  through a program
called  Multiview  Network  Services.  We employ  state-of-the-art  conferencing
servers that provide seamless  connectivity for all switched digital networks at
an affordable rate. Because of the significant expense associated with procuring
multipoint conferencing equipment,  our customers typically elect instead to use
our Multiview Network Services as and when bridging is required.

Sales And Marketing

We market and sell our  products  and  services to the  commercial,  government,
medical  and  educational  markets  through  a direct  sales  force  of  account
executives,  as well as through  telemarketers and resellers.  These efforts are
supported  by sales  engineers,  a  marketing  department,  a call  center and a
professional  services and engineering group. As of December 31, 2001, we had 66
account  executives and 34 additional  sales  administrative  and management and
marketing department personnel.

Our marketing department concentrates on activities that will generate leads for
our sales  force  and  create  brand  awareness  for Wire One and the  Glowpoint
network,  including  direct  marketing  campaigns,  select  advertising,  a call
center,  public relations,  participation in trade shows and the coordination of
seminars  throughout the country.  We host these  seminars to demonstrate  video
communications   systems  to  prospective  customers  and  to  educate  them  on
technological advancements in video and data communications. We also provide our
sales force with ongoing training to ensure that it has the necessary  expertise
to effectively market and promote our business and solutions.

In conjunction  with  manufacturer-sponsored  programs,  we provide existing and
prospective  customers with sales,  advertising  and promotional  materials.  We
maintain  up-to-date  systems for demonstration  purposes in all of our offices.


                                      -3-
            <page>
             Our  technical  and training  personnel  periodically  attend  installation  and
service  training  sessions  offered by video  communications  manufacturers  to
enhance their knowledge and expertise in the installation and maintenance of the
systems.

Customers

We  have  sold  our  products  and  services  to  over  3,000  customers,  which
collectively  have  approximately  16,000  videoconferencing   endpoints.  These
customers operate in each of the following market segments: commercial, medical,
educational and  governmental.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of
our revenues. At December 31, 2001, we maintained a backlog of sales orders with
related revenue totaling $1.8 million.

Technology

The Glowpoint network

Glowpoint   employs   a   proprietary   network   architecture   consisting   of
state-of-the-art equipment co-located at WorldCom and Exodus data centers across
the country,  each one constituting a Glowpoint point of presence  ("POP"),  and
dedicated  capacity on  WorldCom's  and  Exodus's  high  performance,  redundant
backbones.  This  backbone  network  connects  all of  Glowpoint's  POPs,  using
multiple  high-speed OC-3 and OC-12 lines, which virtually eliminate the risk of
a single  point of failure.  Our POPs consist of the best  available  technology
from multiple vendors combined in a proprietary architecture and co-located in a
secure and monitored  environment.  This  configuration of equipment at the POPs
and their  locations  distributed  across the  country  are  expected to provide
industry-leading  throughput,  scalability and mission-critical  resiliency. All
equipment on the network complies with current H.323 (IP) standards.

Currently,  we have 13 POPs strategically  located throughout the United States,
as well as in the UK and Japan.  We have  contracted with WorldCom and Covad and
others,  and plan to contract with additional  broadband access  providers,  for
dedicated broadband access to the Glowpoint network using either DSL, T1 or T3.

Network operations center

We maintain a state-of-the-art NOC at our headquarters from which we monitor the
operations  of Glowpoint on a 24x7 basis.  The NOC's  primary  functions  are to
monitor the network,  manage and support all backbone  equipment,  provide usage
information  for billing,  provide  utilization  data for capacity  planning and
provide value-added customer services. Only usage information and authentication
packets,  rather than actual video  communications  traffic,  passes through the
NOC. Technology in the NOC includes gatekeepers,  routers and switches, servers,
firewalls and load-balancing devices. The NOC uses redundant circuits to connect
directly to our backbone.

Research and Development

As of  December  31,  2001,  we  employed a staff of 12  software  and  hardware
engineers who evaluate, test and develop proprietary applications.  The costs of
this team of engineers in the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled approximately
$1 million.  In the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the costs related to
this team of engineers totaled $120,000 and $0,  respectively.  To augment these
resources, we engage independent  consultants from time-to-time.  We expect that
we will continue to commit  resources to research and  development in the future
to further develop our proprietary network solution.

             <page>
              Employees

As of December 31, 2001, we had 388 full-time employees. Of these employees, 100
are in sales  and  marketing,  250 in  maintenance  and  installation  services,
technical  services and customer  support and 38 in finance and  administration.
None of our  employees  is  represented  by a labor  union.  We believe that our
employee relations are good.

Competition

We compete primarily with  manufacturers  and resellers of video  communications
systems,  some of which are larger,  have longer  operating  histories  and have
greater financial resources and industry  recognition than us. These competitors
include FVC.com, Tandberg and VTEL Corporation.

We also  compete  with  providers of video  communications  transport  services,
including AT&amp;T Corporation,  WorldCom, Qwest Communications,  Sprint Corporation
and several other regional Bell operating companies and carriers. In the future,
competition  may increase from new and existing  resellers,  from  manufacturers
that   choose  to  sell  direct  to  end  users  and  from   existing   and  new
telecommunications   services  providers,  which  may  include  certain  of  our
suppliers or network providers,  many of which have greater financial  resources
than us.

We compete primarily on the basis of our:

     o    sole focus on the video communications industry;

     o    breadth of video product and service offerings;

     o    relationships with video equipment manufacturers;

     o    nationwide presence;

     o    technical expertise;

     o    knowledgeable sales, service and training personnel; and

     o    commitment to customer service and support.

We believe that our ability to compete  successfully  will depend on a number of
factors  both  within and  outside  our  control,  including  the  adoption  and
evolution of technologies relating to our business,  the pricing policies of our
competitors  and  suppliers,  our ability to hire and retain key  technical  and
management personnel and industry and general economic conditions.

                  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with the  Company's
consolidated  financial  statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in
this Form 10-K. All statements  contained herein that are not historical  facts,
including,  but not limited to, statements regarding  anticipated future capital
requirements,  our future  development plans, our ability to obtain debt, equity
or other financing, and our ability to generate cash from operations,  are based
on current expectations. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not
be  construed  to  imply  any  conclusion  that  such  results  or  trends  will
necessarily continue in the future.

The statements contained herein, other than historical  information,  are or may
be deemed to be forward-looking  statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 21E of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  and involve factors,  risks and uncertainties
that may  cause  the  Company's  actual  results  in  future  periods  to differ
materially from such statements. These factors, risks and uncertainties, include
the relatively  short operating  history of the Company;  market  acceptance and
availability  of  new  products  and  services;   the   terminable-at-will   and
nonexclusive   nature  of  reseller   agreements   with   manufacturers;   rapid
technological  change affecting  products and services sold by the Company;  the
impact of competitive  products,  services,  and pricing, as well as competition
from other resellers and service  providers;  possible delays in the shipment of
new products;  and the availability of sufficient  financial resources to enable
the Company to expand its operations.

Overview

Wire One is a leading single source provider of video  communications  solutions
that  encompass the entire video  communications  value chain.  We are a leading
integrator for major video communications equipment manufacturers, including the
number one market share leader,  Polycom,  Inc.  ("Polycom")  which accounts for
over 50% of the installed  videoconferencing  endpoints in the United States. In
December  2000,  we  introduced  our Glowpoint  network  service,  providing our
customers with two-way video  communications with high quality of service.  With
the  introduction  of  Glowpoint,  we now offer our  customers a single point of
contact for all their video communications requirements. Furthermore, we believe
Glowpoint is the first dedicated network to provide two-way video communications
by utilizing a dedicated Internet Protocol ("IP") backbone and broadband access.

We  market  and sell our  video  communications  products  and  services  to the
commercial,  federal  and state  government,  medical  and  educational  markets
through a direct sales force of account executives and telemarketers and through
resellers.   These  efforts  are  supported  by  sales  engineers,  a  marketing
department, a call center and a professional services and engineering group. The
Company  has  sold  its  products  and  services  to over  3,000  customers  who
collectively have approximately 16,000 videoconferencing endpoints.

Wire One was formed on May 18,  2000 by the  merger of ACC and VTI.  VTI was the
surviving legal entity in the merger. However, for financial reporting purposes,
the merger has been accounted for as a "reverse  acquisition" using the purchase
method of accounting.  Under the purchase method of accounting, ACC's historical
results have been carried forward and VTI's operations have been included in the
financial  statements  commencing  on the  merger  date.  Accordingly,  all 1999
results as well as 2000  results  through the merger date are those of ACC only.
Further,  on the date of the  merger,  the  assets and  liabilities  of VTI were
recorded at their fair values, with the excess purchase consideration  allocated
to goodwill.

We sell both products and services. Product revenue consists of revenue from the
sale  of  video  communications  equipment  and is  recognized  at the  time  of
shipment, provided no significant obligations remain, collectibility is probable
and returns are estimable.  Service revenue is derived from services rendered in
connection  with the  sale of new  systems  and the  maintenance  of  previously
installed systems.  Services rendered in connection with the sale of new systems
consist  of  engineering  services  related  to  system  integration,  technical
training  and user  training.  The  majority of the  services are rendered at or
prior to installation, and all revenue is recognized when services are rendered.
Revenue  related to extended  service  contracts is deferred and recognized over

                   the life of the extended service period.  Revenues related to providing  network
services  (either  H.323  Bridging or Glowpoint IP Network) are  recognized on a
monthly basis for services rendered and detailed on a monthly bill.

In July  2000,  we  acquired  the net  assets of  2CONFER,  LLC  ("2CONFER"),  a
Chicago-based provider of videoconferencing, audio and data solutions. The total
consideration was $800,000,  consisting of $500,000 in cash and the remainder in
our common stock valued at the time of acquisition  at $300,000.  On the date of
the  acquisition,  the assets and  liabilities of 2CONFER were recorded at their
fair values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

In October  2000,  we acquired the assets and certain  liabilities  of the Johns
Brook Company ("JBC") videoconferencing division, a New Jersey-based provider of
videoconferencing solutions. The total consideration was $635,000, consisting of
$481,000 in cash and the  remainder  in our common  stock  valued at the time of
acquisition at $154,000. On the date of the acquisition,  the assets and certain
liabilities  of the JBC  videoconferencing  division were recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

In June 2001, we acquired the assets of GeoVideo Networks, Inc. ("GeoVideo"),  a
New  York-based  developer  of video  communications  software.  Chief among the
assets,  in addition to GeoVideo's  cash on hand of  $2,500,000,  was GeoVideo's
browser, a software tool based upon proprietary Bell Labs technology that allows
up to  six  simultaneous,  real-time,  bi-directional  high-bandwidth  IP  video
sessions  to be  conducted  over a  standard  desktop  PC. In  exchange  for the
acquired  assets,  we issued 815,661  shares of our common stock,  together with
warrants to purchase 501,733  additional shares of our common stock at $5.50 per
share and  520,123  shares at $7.50 per share.  On the date of  acquisition  the
assets of GeoVideo were recorded at their fair values,  with the excess purchase
consideration  allocated  to  goodwill.  A final  appraisal  of  certain  assets
included in the acquisition  has not been completed.  Pending the results of the
appraisal, the allocation among the various components of the purchase price may
change;  however,  any such  reallocation will not materially affect our overall
financial position or results of operations.

In July 2001,  we  acquired  the  assets and  certain  liabilities  of  Advanced
Acoustical  Concepts,  Inc.  ("AAC"),  an  Ohio-based  designer  of  audiovisual
conferencing  systems.  The total consideration was $794,000,  which was paid in
the form of our common stock valued at the time of  acquisition.  On the date of
acquisition,  the assets and  certain  liabilities  were  recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase  consideration  allocated to goodwill.  A final
appraisal of certain assets  included in the acquisition has not been completed.
Pending  the  results  of  the  appraisal,  the  allocation  among  the  various
components of the purchase price may change; however, any such reallocation will
not materially affect our overall financial position or results of operations.

In October 2001, we completed the sale of our voice communications business unit
to Fairfield,  N.J.-based Phonextra, Inc. for approximately $2,017,000,  half of
which was paid in cash at the close of the  transaction and the balance of which
was paid in the form of a promissory  note  self-amortizing  over one year.  The
sale of our voice  communications  unit was aimed at  enabling us to sharpen our
focus on video  solutions  and on  Glowpoint,  our  subscriber-based  IP network
dedicated to video communications traffic. As a consequence,  this unit has been
classified as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements,
with its net assets and results from operations  summarized in single line items
on our balance sheet and statement of operations.

In  November  2001,  we acquired  certain  assets and  liabilities  of the video
conferencing  division of Axxis, Inc.  ("Axxis"),  a Kentucky-based  designer of
audiovisual conferencing systems. The total consideration was $2,051,000,  which
was paid in the form of our common stock valued at the time of  acquisition.  On
the date of acquisition,  the acquired  assets and liabilities  were recorded at
their fair values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.
A final  appraisal of certain assets  included in the  acquisition  has not been
completed.  Pending  the  results of the  appraisal,  the  allocation  among the
various  components  of  the  purchase  price  may  change;  however,  any  such
reallocation  will not  materially  affect our  overall  financial  position  or
results of operations.

     NET  REVENUES.  We reported  total  revenues of $88.9  million for the 2001
period, an increase of $40.5 million, or 84%, over the $48.4 million in revenues
reported for the 2000 period. Although the operations of acquired companies have
now been fully  integrated,  management  estimates  that  revenues from the core
businesses in existence before  contributions from acquired operations accounted
for $16.3  million of the $40.5  million  increase,  or 40%,  with  acquisitions
accounting  for $24.2  million  of the  increase,  or 60%.  When  adjusting  for
acquisitions  made in 2000 and 2001,  assuming they contributed to the full 2001
and 2000  periods,  revenue for the year  increased  21%,  from $83.7 million to
$100.9 million.

Video  solutions -- Sales of video  communications  products  and services  were
$85.4 million in the 2001 period, an increase of $38.4 million, or 82%, over the
$47.0 million in the 2000 period.  Management estimates that approximately $15.2
million of the $38.4  million  increase in revenues for the 2001 period over the
2000  period,  or 40%,  related  to the  core  businesses  in  existence  before
contributions  from acquired  operations and $23.2 million in revenues,  or 60%,
from  acquired  operations  accounted  for the  remainder  of the  growth.  When
adjusting for acquisitions  made in 2000 and 2001,  assuming they contributed to
the full 2001 and 2000 periods,  revenue for the year  increased 20%, from $81.2
million to $97.4 million.  The growth  experienced  in the 2001 period  resulted

                     from sales to both new and existing  customers in the commercial,  governmental,
medical and educational  markets in each of the major geographic  regions in the
United  States  in which we  operate.  Growth  was  positively  impacted  by the
expansion  of the use of  videoconferencing  and by the  migration  of  numerous
organizations to  videoconferencing  as an alternative to corporate travel, both
for budgetary and safety reasons.

     Video network -- Sales of video  network  services were $3.5 million in the
2001 period, an increase of $2.0 million,  or 133%, over the $1.5 million in the
2000 period.  Management  estimates that  approximately $0.4 million of the $2.0
million increase in revenues for the 2001 period over the 2000 period related to
growth resulting from the introduction of the Glowpoint network and $1.6 million
in revenues from VTI's H.320 bridging service accounted for the remainder of the
growth.

     GROSS  MARGINS.  Gross  margins were $26.8  million in the 2001 period,  an
increase of $11.0 million over the 2000 period.  Gross margins  decreased in the
2001 period to 30.2% of net  revenues,  as compared to 32.6% of net  revenues in
the 2000 period. The decrease is attributable to overall  competitive  pressures
in the video  solutions  market  resulting from the relatively  weak economy and
downward pricing pressure  instigated by competitors,  and the  disproportionate
amount of sales of large low-margin  multipoint  bridge equipment in the current
year's revenues,  which accounted for approximately  0.9% of the 2.4% decline in
margin.

     SELLING.  Selling  expenses,  which  include sales  salaries,  commissions,
overhead,  and marketing  costs,  increased  $12.3 million in the 2001 period to
$24.9  million  from $12.6  million for the 2000  period.  Increases  in selling
expenses are  attributable  to increases  in the number of sales  personnel  and
their related costs totaling $7.5 million, the costs of additional sales offices
resulting  from  acquisitions  since May 2000 totaling $1.0 million and the $2.5
million of recurring costs related to the Glowpoint  division not yet covered by
revenues.  Selling  expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the 2001 period
were  28.0%,  an  increase  from  26.0% in the 2000  period.  This  increase  is
attributable  to the $2.5 million of expenses of the Glowpoint  division,  which
amounted to 2.8% of net revenue.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative  expenses increased
$8.5 million in the 2001 period to $12.6 million as compared to $4.1 million for
the 2000  period.  This  category  of  expense  was  significantly  impacted  by
non-recurring  charges that were  recognized in the fourth  quarter of 2001. The
most  significant  of these  charges were the $4.0 million  charge  related to a
five-year  extension of certain  stock  options  granted to the Company's CEO in
1997, the one-time  non-cash charge of $630,000 for accelerated  amortization of
Glowpoint-related  capitalized  costs and the  $375,000  charge  related  to the
settlement   of   outstanding   litigation.   The   inclusion   of  general  and
administrative  expenses related to acquired  companies was another  significant
factor  behind the  increase.  Core  general and  administrative  expenses  were
approximately  $6.9  million  for the 2001  period,  or 7.7% of net  revenue,  a
decrease from 8.5% in the 2000 period,  as these costs were leveraged as we grew
in the 2001 period.

     AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL.  Amortization of goodwill  increased $1.2 million
in the 2001  period to $2.7  million as  compared  to $1.5  million for the 2000
period.  The increase related to a full year of amortization of goodwill related
to the VTI,  2CONFER and JBC  acquisitions  ($1.1  million of the  increase) and
goodwill amortization related to the acquisition of GeoVideo of $0.1 million.

     OTHER (INCOME)  EXPENSES.  One component of this category,  amortization of
deferred  financing costs,  decreased to $100,000 in the 2001 period as compared
to $344,000 in the 2000 period.  The decrease reflects the absence from the 2001
period of the  amortization  of $305,000  related to the issuance of warrants to
former VTI subordinated debt holders. In addition,  interest income decreased in
the 2001  period to $77,000 as compared  to  $315,000  in the 2000  period.  The
decrease reflects decreased funds invested during the 2001 period as the capital
raised in prior periods was deployed in operations.  Interest expense  increased
in the 2001 period to $598,000 as compared to $78,000 in the 2000 period. During
the 2001 period we expanded our use of our line of credit to fund our operations
with the result being a significant increase in interest expense.

                      INCOME  TAXES.  During the 2001  period,  we have  established  a valuation
allowance to offset the benefits of significant temporary tax differences due to
the  uncertainty  of  their  realization.  These  deferred  tax  assets  consist
primarily of net operating  losses carried  forward in the VTI merger,  reserves
and allowances, and stock-based compensation.  Due to the nature of the deferred
tax  assets,  the  related  tax  benefits,  upon  realization,  will be credited
substantially to the goodwill asset or additional  paid-in capital,  rather than
to income tax expense.

     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. We incurred a loss from discontinued operations in
the 2001 period of $617,000 as compared to income from  discontinued  operations
in the 2000  period  of  $521,000.  This  decline  in income  from  discontinued
operations  resulted  from lower  revenues to cover the fixed costs of the voice
communications  unit and  higher  costs of  revenues  as  competitive  pressures
reduced gross margins.

     NET  INCOME  (LOSS).   We  reported  a  net  loss  attributable  to  common
stockholders  for the 2001  period of $(19.0)  million,  or $(0.91)  per diluted
share, as compared to net loss  attributable  to common  stockholders of $(16.3)
million, or $(1.27) per diluted share for the 2000 period.  Before giving effect
to the  aggregate  $4.4  million  in deemed  dividends  on series A  convertible
preferred stock in the 2001 period and $13.7 million in deemed  dividends in the
2000 period,  we reported a net loss of $(14.5)  million for the 2001 period and
$(2.5) million for the 2000 period.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 ("2000 period") Compared to Year Ended December 31,
1999 ("1999 period").

     NET  REVENUES.  We  reported  net  revenues  of $48.4  million for the 2000
period, an increase of $36.0 million over the $12.4 million in revenues reported
for the 1999 period. Although the operations of acquired companies have now been
fully integrated, management estimates that revenues from the core businesses in
existence  before  contributions  from acquired  operations  accounted for $10.4
million of the $36.0 million increase, or 29%, with acquisitions  accounting for
$25.6 million of the increase, or 71%.

     Video solutions -- Sales of video communications products and services were
$46.9 million in the 2000 period,  an increase of $34.5 million,  or 278%,  over
the $12.4 million in the 1999 period.  Management  estimates that  approximately
$10.2 million of the $34.5 million increase in revenues for the 2000 period over
the 1999 period,  or 30%,  related to the core  businesses  in existence  before
contributions  from acquired  operations and $24.3 million in revenues,  or 70%,
from acquired  operations  accounted for the remainder of the growth. The growth
experienced  in the 2000  period  resulted  from sales to both new and  existing
customers in the commercial,  governmental,  medical and educational  markets in
each of the major geographic regions in the United States in which we operate.

     Video network -- Sales of video  network  services were $1.5 million in the
2000 period with no revenue  recognized  in the 1999  period.  This  increase in
revenues  consisted  of the $1.5  million in revenues  from the  acquired  H.320
bridging service of VTI.

     GROSS  MARGINS.  Gross  profits were $15.8  million in the 2000 period,  an
increase of $12.0 million over the 1999 period.  Gross margins  increased in the
2000 period to 32.6% of net  revenues,  as compared to 30.8% of net  revenues in
the 1999 period.  The increase is attributable to inventory  purchase  discounts
negotiated  with  videoconferencing  equipment  manufacturers  and  increases in
higher margin revenue sources such as consulting and technical  services,  video
maintenance contracts and installation services.

SELLING. Selling expenses, which include sales salaries, commissions,  overhead,
and marketing costs, increased $10.1 million in the 2000 period to $12.6 million
from $2.5  million  for the 1999  period.  Increases  in  selling  expenses  are
attributable  to increases in the number of sales  personnel  and their  related
costs and the costs of additional  sales offices  resulting from the merger with
VTI and the acquisitions of 2CONFER and JBC. The increase in selling expenses as
a percentage  of net revenues in the 2000 period  resulted from the expansion of
the video communications  division on a national basis. Prior to the merger, ACC
focused its video  communications  business on customers  in the Eastern  United
States.  This national  expansion  resulted in increased rent and related office
expenses, depreciation, travel and delivery expenses as a percentage of revenue.

                      <page>
                       GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative  expenses increased
$2.4  million in the 2000 period to $4.1 million as compared to $1.7 million for
the 1999 period. The inclusion of VTI general and  administrative  expenses from
the merger date  through  the end of the  reporting  period was the  significant
factor  behind  these  increases.  General  and  administrative  expenses  as  a
percentage of net revenues for 2000 period decreased to 8.5% from 14.2%, as this
cost category was leveraged over the greater base of revenues.

     AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL.  We allocated  approximately $34.7 million of the
VTI merger purchase consideration to goodwill. Amortization expense attributable
to this merger for the 2000 period  totaled $1.45  million.  We estimate at this
time that the annual amortization  expense attributable to this merger (based on
an amortization  period of 15 years) will approximate $2.3 million. In addition,
as a result of the  acquisition of the net assets of 2CONFER in July 2000 and of
JBC  in  October  2000,  $1.8  million  of  additional  goodwill  was  recorded.
Amortization  expense  attributable  to these  acquisitions  for the 2000 period
totaled  approximately  $50,000  and we  estimate  at this time that the  annual
amortization   expense   attributable  to  these   acquisitions   (based  on  an
amortization period of 15 years) will approximate $120,000.

     OTHER  (INCOME)  EXPENSES.   The  principal  component  of  this  category,
amortization  of deferred  financing  costs,  increased  to $344,000 in the 2000
period as compared to $43,000 in the 1999  period.  The  increase  reflects  the
amortization  of  $305,000  related to the  issuance  of  warrants to former VTI
subordinated  debt holders.  These costs were fully amortized as of December 31,
2000. In addition,  interest income  increased in the 2000 period to $315,000 as
compared to $23,000 in the 1999 period. The increase reflects interest earned on
the proceeds received from our private placement of 2,450 shares of its series A
convertible  preferred stock and related  warrants (the "Private  Placement") in
the second  quarter of 2000 and the proceeds  received  from our warrant call in
the first quarter of 2000.

     INCOME TAXES.  During the 2000 period, we established a valuation allowance
to offset the  benefits of  significant  temporary  tax  differences  due to the
uncertainty of their realization. These deferred tax assets consist primarily of
net operating losses carried forward in the VTI merger, reserves and allowances,
and stock-based compensation.  Due to the nature of the deferred tax assets, the
related tax benefits,  upon realization,  will be credited  substantially to the
goodwill asset or additional paid-in capital, rather than to income tax expense.

     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  We had income from discontinued operations in the
2000 period of $521,000 as compared to income from  discontinued  operations  in
the 1999  period of $1.6  million.  This  decline  in income  from  discontinued
operations  resulted  from lower  revenues to cover the fixed costs of the voice
communications  unit and  higher  costs of  revenues  as  competitive  pressures
reduced gross margins. The lower revenues resulted from declines in revenue from
three  significant  customers and due to revenues in the 1999 period  related to
Y2K telephone system upgrades that did not recur in the 2000 period.

     NET  INCOME  (LOSS).   We  reported  a  net  loss  attributable  to  common
stockholders  for the 2000  period of $(16.3)  million,  or $(1.27)  per diluted
share,  as compared to net income  attributable  to common  stockholders of $1.1
million, or $.17 per diluted share for the 1999 period. At the issuance date, we
recorded a deemed  dividend and an  offsetting  increase in  additional  paid-in
capital of  approximately  $8.1  million to reflect  the  beneficial  conversion
feature of the preferred stock. During the fourth quarter of 2000, in accordance
with EITF No. 00-27,  we recorded an additional  deemed dividend of $3.9 million
to reflect the beneficial  conversion  feature of the warrants.  In addition,  a
$1.7 million deemed dividend was recorded in the period to amortize the costs of
the Private  Placement.  Costs of $6.15 million  incurred in connection with the
Private Placement, including the fair value of warrants, have been recorded as a
preferred  stock  discount and will be amortized as a deemed  dividend  over the
three-year  period from the date of issuance  to the  current  redemption  date.
Before  giving effect to the aggregate  $13.7  million in deemed  dividends,  we
reported a net loss of $(2.5)  million  for the 2000  period as  compared to net
income of $1.1 million for the 1999 period.

                        Liquidity And Capital Resources

     At December 31, 2001, we had working  capital of $15.6 million  compared to
$19.9 million at December 31, 2000, a decrease of approximately 22%. If our bank
line of credit is reclassified in the 2000 period to be a current liability, the
decrease is approximately  8%, from $16.9 million to $15.6 million.  At December
31, 2001, we had $1.7 million in cash and cash  equivalents  (of which  $900,000
was  restricted  as to its use; see note 2) compared to $1.9 million at December
31, 2000. This change in working capital  position  resulted  primarily from the
use of working capital to fund capital expenditures.

     In August  2001,  we  raised  net  proceeds  of $9.9  million  in a private
placement of 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.00 per share.
Investors in the private placement also received  five-year warrants to purchase
814,000  shares of common  stock at an  exercise  price of $6.25 per share.  The
warrants are subject to certain anti-dilution  protection. We also issued to our
placement agent five-year warrants to purchase 220,000 shares of common stock at
an exercise price of $5.00 per share.

     We  currently  have  a  $15.0  million working capital credit facility with
an  asset-based  lender.  Borrowings  under this  facility  bear interest at the
lender's base rate plus 1/2% per annum. At December 31, 2001 amounts outstanding
under the facility were $10.6  million.  Our credit  facility  contains  certain
financial and operational covenants. For the period from October 1, 2001 through
December 31, 2001 ("2001 Fourth Quarter"),  we were in violation of the earnings
before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization  ("EBITDA") and interest
coverage  ratio  covenants  under the facility.  On March 26, 2002,  the Company
received a waiver  from the lender  regarding  these  requirements  for the 2001
Fourth Quarter. At December 31, 2001, the loan has been classified as current in
the  accompanying  balance sheet because this facility  matures in less than one
year.

Future  minimum  rental  commitments  under  all  non-cancelable  leases  are as

     Net cash used in operating activities for the 2001 period was $15.5 million
as  compared to net cash used by  operations  of $14.0  million  during the 2000
period. Sources of operating cash in 2001 included increases in accrued expenses
and other  current  liabilities  of $0.7  million and  deferred  revenue of $0.3
million,  and a decrease in  inventory  of $0.5  million.  Increases in accounts
receivable of $10.7  million  resulting  from sales  growth,  increases in other
current assets  totaling $1.8 million and decreases in accounts  payable of $2.1
million were the primary uses of operating cash in the 2001 period.

     Investing activities for the 2001 period included purchases of $2.7 million
for  bridging,  computer and  demonstration  equipment for the core business and
$5.3 million for computer, network and office equipment related to the Glowpoint
division. The Glowpoint network is currently built out to handle the anticipated
level of subscriptions for 2002. Although we anticipate current expansion of the
Glowpoint network and our core business,  we have no significant  commitments to
make capital expenditures for Glowpoint or the core business in 2002. Cash costs
incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions totaled $0.2 million in the
2001 period.

                         Financing  activities in the 2001 period included net borrowings  under our
revolving credit line totaling $7.6 million, the issuance of common stock valued
at $2.5  million  for the  assets of  GeoVideo,  issuance  of common  stock in a
private  placement  yielding net proceeds of $9.9 million and proceeds  from the
exercise of warrants and options totaling $1.6 million.

In January 2002, we raised net proceeds of $20.2 million in a private  placement
of 3,526,500 shares of its common stock at a price of $6.25 per share. Investors
in the private  placement also received  five-year  warrants to purchase 864,375
shares of common  stock at an exercise  price of $10.00 per share.  The warrants
are subject to certain anti-dilution  protection.  $12.0 million of the proceeds
from the  offering  were used to pay down the bank  line of credit to zero.  The
remaining proceeds will be used to fund the continuing development and marketing
of  our  Glowpoint  video  communications  network  and  for  general  corporate
purposes.

     Management  believes,  based upon current  circumstances,  we have adequate
capital  resources  to support  current  operating  levels for at least the next
twelve months.

Critical accounting policies

We prepare our financial  statements in accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Preparing  financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles requires
us to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets
and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities as of the
date of the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of  revenues  and
expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  The  following  paragraphs  include a
discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required.  You should also
review Note 2 to the financial  statements for further discussion of significant
accounting policies.

Revenue recognition

We sell both products and services. Product revenue consists of revenue from the
sale  of  video  communications  equipment  and is  recognized  at the  time  of
shipment, provided no significant obligations remain, collectibility is probable
and returns are estimable.  Service revenue is derived from services rendered in
connection  with the  sale of new  systems  and the  maintenance  of  previously
installed systems.  Services rendered in connection with the sale of new systems
consist  of  engineering  services  related  to  system  integration,  technical
training  and user  training.  The  majority of the  services are rendered at or
prior to installation, and all revenue is recognized when services are rendered.
Revenue  related to extended  service  contracts is deferred and recognized over
the life of the extended service period.

Long-lived assets

We evaluate impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations, primarily
fixed  assets and  goodwill,  when events and  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying  value of the  assets  and  goodwill,  might  not be  recoverable.  For
purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the undiscounted
cash flows  estimated  to be  generated by those assets would be compared to the
carrying amounts of those assets.  If and when the carrying values of the assets
exceed these undiscounted cash flows, the related assets will be written down to
fair  value.  There were no  impairment  losses  recorded  in any of the periods
presented.

Recent pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board

In June 1998 the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("FAS  133").  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities",  which became  effective  for the Company
during the first  quarter  of 2001.  FAS 133  requires  the  recognition  of all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and measurement
of those  instruments  at fair  value.  To date,  we have not  entered  into any
derivative  or hedging  activities,  and, as such,  the  adoption of FAS 133, as
amended, has not had a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

                                      -16-
                         <page>
                          In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board finalized FASB Statements
No. 141,  Business  Combinations  ("FAS 141"),  and No. 142,  Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets ("FAS 142").  FAS 141 requires the use of the purchase method
of  accounting  and  prohibits  the  use of the  pooling-of-interest  method  of
accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. FAS 141 also
requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the
acquired  intangible  assets  meet  certain  criteria.  FAS 141  applies  to all
business  combinations  initiated after June 30, 2001 and for purchase  business
combinations completed on or after July 1, 2001. It also requires, upon adoption
of FAS 142, that we reclassify, if necessary, the carrying amounts of intangible
assets and goodwill based on the criteria in FAS 141.

FAS 142  requires,  among  other  things,  that  companies  no  longer  amortize
goodwill,  but instead  test  goodwill  for  impairment  at least  annually.  In
addition,  FAS 142 requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, reassess the useful lives of
other  existing   recognized   intangible  assets,  and  cease  amortization  of
intangible  assets with an indefinite  useful life. An intangible  asset with an
indefinite  useful life should be tested for  impairment in accordance  with the
guidance in FAS 142. FAS 142 is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001 to all goodwill and other intangible  assets  recognized
at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially recognized. FAS 142
requires us to complete a transitional  goodwill impairment test six months from
the date of adoption.  The Company is also required to reassess the useful lives
of other  intangible  assets within the first interim  quarter after adoption of
FAS 142.

With respect to the business  combinations  that were effected prior to June 30,
2001,  using the purchase method of accounting,  the net carrying amounts of the
resulting goodwill as of December 31, 2001 was $36,775,028. Amortization expense
for the  year  ended  December  31,  2001 was  $2,683,647.  At  present,  we are
currently assessing,  but have not yet determined,  the impact that the adoption
of FAS 141 and FAS 142  will  have on our  financial  position  and  results  of
operations.

In August  2001,  the FASB issued FASB  Statement  No. 144,  Accounting  for the
Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets  ("FAS  144").  The new  guidance
resolves  significant  implementation  issues related to FASB Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed  Of ("FAS  121").  FAS 144  supercedes  FAS 121,  but it retains its
fundamental  provisions.  It also  amends  Account  Research  Bulletin  No.  51,
Consolidated  Financial Statements,  to eliminate the exception to consolidate a
subsidiary  for which  control is likely to be  temporary.  FAS 144  retains the
requirement  of FAS 121 to  recognize  an  impairment  loss only if the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset within the scope of FAS 144 is not recoverable from
its undiscounted cash flows and exceeds its fair value.

FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2001,  and
interim periods within those fiscal years,  with early  application  encouraged.
The Company has early adopted the  provisions of FAS 144 as of December 31, 2001
to recognize discontinued business operations in its financial statements.

Inflation

Management  does not  believe  inflation  had a material  adverse  effect on the
financial statements for the periods presented.

                           ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We have  exposure to  interest  rate risk  related to our cash  equivalents
     portfolio.  The primary  objective of our investment  policy is to preserve
     principal  while  maximizing  yields.  Our cash  equivalents  portfolio  is
     short-term  in  nature,  therefore  changes  in  interest  rates  will  not
     materially  impact our  consolidated  financial  condition.  However,  such
     interest rate changes can cause  fluctuations  in our results of operations
     and cash flows.

We maintain  borrowings under a $15 million working capital credit facility with
an asset based  lender that are not  subject to  material  market risk  exposure
except for such risks relating to fluctuations  in market  interest  rates.  The
carrying  value of these  borrowings  approximates  fair  value  since they bear
interest  at a  floating  rate  based on the  "prime"  rate.  There are no other
material qualitative or quantitative market risks particular to the Company.

                            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and the
Stockholders of Wire One Technologies, Inc.

We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of Wire  One
Technologies,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the
related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2001.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in  all  material   respects,   the  financial  position  of  Wire  One
Technologies,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  at December  31, 2001 and 2000,  and the
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31, 2001 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         December 31, 2001 2000 and 1999

Note 1 -- The Business and Merger with View Tech, Inc.

Wire One  Technologies,  Inc.  ("Wire One" or the  "Company")  was formed by the
merger of All Communications  Corporation ("ACC") and View Tech, Inc. ("VTI") on
May 18, 2000, with the former directors and senior  management of ACC succeeding
to the  management  of Wire One.  In  connection  with the  merger,  each former
shareholder  of ACC received 1.65 shares of Wire One common stock for each share
of ACC common stock held by them.  The  transaction  has been accounted for as a
"reverse  acquisition"  using the  purchase  method of  accounting.  The reverse
acquisition  method resulted in ACC being  recognized as the acquirer of VTI for
accounting  and financial  reporting  purposes.  As a result,  ACC's  historical
results have been carried forward and VTI's operations have been included in the
financial statements  commencing on the merger date.  Accordingly,  all 1999 and
2000 results through the merger date are those of ACC only. Further, on the date
of the merger,  the assets and  liabilities  of VTI were  recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

Wire One is engaged in the business of selling,  installing and servicing  video
communications  systems  to  commercial  and  institutional   customers  located
principally  within the United States. The Company is headquartered in Hillside,
New Jersey.  During 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company did not segregate or manage
its operations by business segments.

Note 2 -- Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  AllComm  Products  Corporation  ("APC"),  VTC
Resources,  Inc.  ("VTC")  and Wire One  Travel  Services,  Inc.  ("WOTS").  All
material   intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation.

Use of estimates

Preparation  of  the  consolidated   financial  statements  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts  of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial  statement and the reported  amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual amounts could differ
from the estimates made. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the
preparation   of  the  financial   statements   for  continued   reasonableness.
Appropriate  adjustments,  if any, to the estimates used are made  prospectively
based upon such periodic evaluation.  It is reasonably possible that changes may
occur in the near term that would affect management's  estimates with respect to
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and inventory reserves.

Revenue recognition

The Company  sells both  products  and  services.  Product  revenue  consists of
revenue from the sale of video communications equipment and is recognized at the
time of shipment, provided no significant obligations remain,  collectibility is
probable and returns are  estimable.  Service  revenue is derived from  services
rendered  in  connection  with the sale of new systems  and the  maintenance  of
previously  installed systems.  Services rendered in connection with the sale of
new  systems  consist of  engineering  services  related to system  integration,
technical training and user training.  The majority of the services are rendered
at or prior to  installation,  and all revenue is  recognized  when services are


                                      F-6
                                 <page>
                                  rendered.  Revenue  related  to  extended  service  contracts  is  deferred  and
recognized over the life of the extended service period.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company  considers  all highly  liquid debt  instruments  with a maturity of
three  months  or less  when  purchased  to be cash  equivalents.  During  2001,
$900,000 of the cash and cash equivalents  balance was restricted as to its use.
After losing an approximately $745,000 judgement in the Maxbase litigation (note
10),  the Company was  required to set aside these funds in an  interest-bearing
account as it filed its appeal of this judgement.  The  restrictions on $275,000
were lifted when the Company settled the case for $625,000 in early 2002.

Concentration of credit risk

Financial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company to  significant
concentrations of credit risk consist  principally of cash and cash equivalents,
and uncollateralized trade accounts receivable.  The Company places its cash and
cash  equivalents  primarily in  commercial  checking  accounts and money market
funds.  Commercial bank balances may from time to time exceed federal  insurance
limits; money market funds are uninsured.

The Company  performs  ongoing credit  evaluations of its customers.  During the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 the Company's reserve for doubtful
accounts and returns and allowances  was increased by  $1,171,888,  $568,107 and
$104,345,  respectively  for  provisions  for  bad  debts  and  returns  and was
decreased  by  $1,036,888,  $213,107  and  $12,345,  respectively,  for balances
written off. At December  31, 2001 and 2000,  the balance of the  allowance  for
doubtful accounts was $605,000 and $470,000, respectively.

Most of the  products  sold by the Company  are  purchased  under  non-exclusive
dealer  agreements  with  various  manufacturers,  including  Polycom  for video
communications  equipment. The agreements typically specify, among other things,
sales  territories,  payment terms and reseller  prices.  All of the  agreements
permit early  termination on short notice with or without cause. The termination
of any of the Company's  dealer  agreements,  or their renewal on less favorable
terms than  currently  in effect,  could have a material  adverse  impact on the
Company's business.

Inventory

Inventory,  consisting of finished goods and spare parts, is valued at the lower
of cost (determined on a first in, first out basis) or market.  During the years
ended  December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999,  the  Company's  reserve for inventory
obsolescence  was  increased by  $349,313,  $988,916  and $0,  respectively  for
provisions  for obsolete  inventory  and was  decreased by $635,409,  $0 and $0,
respectively  for  inventory  written off. In  addition,  during the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000,  the Company's  reserve for  inventory  obsolescence
increased by $345,950 and $230,690,  respectively  as a result of reserves added
through  acquistions.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the balance of the reserve
for inventory obsolescence was $1,279,459 and $1,219,606, respectively.

Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements

Furniture,  equipment and leasehold  improvements are stated at cost.  Furniture
and equipment  are  depreciated  over the estimated  useful lives of the related
assets,  which  range  from  three to five  years.  Leasehold  improvements  are
amortized  over the  shorter of either the  asset's  useful  life or the related
lease term.  Depreciation is computed on the straight-line  method for financial


                                      F-7
                                  <page>
                                   reporting  purposes and on the modified  accelerated  cost  recovery  system for
income tax purposes.

Intangibles

Cost  in  excess  of the  fair  value  of net  assets  of  purchased  businesses
(goodwill)  is  amortized  using the  straight-line  method  over 15 years,  its
estimated useful life.

Long-lived assets

The Company evaluates impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations,
primarily fixed assets and goodwill, when events and circumstances indicate that
the carrying  value of the assets and goodwill,  might not be  recoverable.  For
purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the undiscounted
cash flows  estimated  to be  generated by those assets would be compared to the
carrying amounts of those assets.  If and when the carrying values of the assets
exceed these undiscounted cash flows, the related assets will be written down to
fair  value.  There were no  impairment  losses  recorded  in any of the periods
presented.

Income taxes

The Company uses the  liability  method to  determine  its income tax expense or
benefit.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are computed  based on temporary
differences  between  the  financial  reporting  and tax  basis  of  assets  and
liabilities  (principally  certain  accrued  expenses,   compensation  expenses,
depreciation  expense and  allowance  for doubtful  accounts),  and are measured
using  the  enacted  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to be in  effect  when the
differences are expected to reverse.

Stock options

Under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation",  the Company must
either  recognize  in its  financial  statements  costs  related to its employee
stock-based  compensation  plans, using the fair value method, or make pro forma
disclosures of such costs in a footnote to the financial statements. The Company
has elected to continue to use the intrinsic  value-based  method of APB Opinion
No. 25, as allowed  under SFAS No. 123, to account for its employee  stock-based
compensation  plans, and to include the required pro forma  disclosures based on
fair value accounting.

The fair  value of  warrants  issued  in return  for  services  rendered  by any
non-employees is charged to operations over the terms of the underlying  service
agreements.

Earnings per share

Basic  earnings  (loss) per share is  calculated  by dividing net income  (loss)
attributable  to common  stockholders by the  weighted-average  number of common
shares outstanding during the period (20,880,125 for the year ended December 31,
2001,  12,817,158  shares for the year ended  December  31,  2000 and  4,910,000
shares for the year ended December 31, 1999).

Diluted  earnings  (loss) per share is  calculated by dividing net income (loss)
attributable  to common  stockholders by the  weighted-average  number of common
shares outstanding, plus the weighted average number of net shares that would be
issued upon exercise of stock options,  warrants and convertible preferred stock
using the treasury  stock  method.  Incremental  shares  included in the diluted
computation were 1,259,074 for 1999. Diluted loss per share for 2001 and 2000 is
the same as basic loss per share, since the effects of the calculation for those
years were anti-dilutive.

Weighted average options and warrants to purchase 9,535,609 and 7,507,204 shares
of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
and preferred stock  convertible  into 2,115,000 common shares in 2000, were not
included in the  computation  of diluted  earnings per share because the Company
reported a net loss  attributable to common  stockholders  for these periods and
their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

                                    Fair value of financial instruments

Financial  instruments  reported in the Company's balance sheet consist of cash,
accounts receivable,  accounts payable and bank loan payable, the carrying value
of which  approximated  fair value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The fair value
of  the   financial   instruments   disclosed   therein   are  not   necessarily
representative of the amount that could be realized or settled nor does the fair
value amount consider the tax consequences of realization or settlement.

Comprehensive income

In 1997, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 130,
"Reporting Comprehensive Income". This standard established requirements for the
reporting and display of  comprehensive  income and its components in a full set
of general purpose financial  statements.  Comprehensive  income is the total of
net income and all other  nonowner  changes in  equity.  The  objective  of this
statement  is to report a measure  of all  changes  in equity of a company  that
result from  transactions  and other  economic  events in the period  other than
transactions  with  owners.  The Company  adopted  SFAS No. 130 during the first
quarter of fiscal 1998, and has no comprehensive  income components to report in
2001, 2000 or 1999.

Recent pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board

In June 1998 the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("FAS  133").  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities",  which became  effective  for the Company
during the first  quarter  of 2001.  FAS 133  requires  the  recognition  of all
derivatives as either assets or  liabilities in the Company's  balance sheet and
measurement  of those  instruments  at fair value.  To date, the Company has not
entered into any derivative or hedging activities, and, as such, the adoption of
FAS 133, as amended, has not had a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board finalized FASB Statements
No. 141,  Business  Combinations  ("FAS 141"),  and No. 142,  Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets ("FAS 142"). FAS 141 requires the use of the purchase  method
of  accounting  and  prohibits  the  use of the  pooling-of-interest  method  of
accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. FAS 141 also
requires  that the  Company  recognize  acquired  intangible  assets  apart from
goodwill if the  acquired  intangible  assets  meet  certain  criteria.  FAS 141
applies to all  business  combinations  initiated  after  June 30,  2001 and for
purchase  business  combinations  completed  on or after July 1,  2001.  It also
requires, upon adoption of FAS 142, that the Company reclassifies, if necessary,
the carrying amounts of intangible  assets and goodwill based on the criteria in
FAS 141.

FAS 142  requires,  among  other  things,  that  companies  no  longer  amortize
goodwill,  but instead  test  goodwill  for  impairment  at least  annually.  In
addition,  FAS 142 requires that the Company  identify  reporting  units for the
purposes of assessing  potential  future  impairments of goodwill,  reassess the
useful  lives  of  other  existing  recognized   intangible  assets,  and  cease
amortization of intangible  assets with an indefinite useful life. An intangible
asset  with an  indefinite  useful  life  should be  tested  for  impairment  in
accordance  with the  guidance in FAS 142.  FAS 142 is required to be applied in
fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2001 to all  goodwill  and other
intangible assets recognized at that date,  regardless of when those assets were
initially  recognized.  FAS 142 requires the Company to complete a  transitional
goodwill  impairment  test six months from the date of adoption.  The Company is
also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the
first interim quarter after adoption of FAS 142.

With respect to the Company's business  combinations that were effected prior to
June 30, 2001, using the purchase method of accounting, the net carrying amounts
of the resulting goodwill as of December 31, 2001 was $36,775,028.  Amortization
expense for the year ended  December 31, 2001 was  $2,683,647.  At present,  the
Company is currently assessing, but has not yet determined,  the impact that the
adoption of FAS 141 and FAS 142 will have on its financial  position and results
of operations.

In August  2001,  the FASB issued FASB  Statement  No. 144,  Accounting  for the
Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets  ("FAS  144").  The new  guidance
resolves  significant  implementation  issues related to FASB Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed  Of ("FAS  121").  FAS 144  supercedes  FAS 121,  but it retains its
fundamental  provisions.  It also  amends  Account  Research  Bulletin  No.  51,
Consolidated  Financial Statements,  to eliminate the exception to consolidate a
subsidiary  for which  control is likely to be  temporary.  FAS 144  retains the
requirement  of FAS 121 to  recognize  an  impairment  loss only if the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset within the scope of FAS 144 is not recoverable from
its undiscounted cash flows and exceeds its fair value.

FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2001,  and
interim periods within those fiscal years,  with early  application  encouraged.
The Company has early adopted the  provisions of FAS 144 as of December 31, 2001
to recognize discontinued business operations in its financial statements.

                                     Note 3 - Discontinued Operations

On October 24, 2001, the Company completed the sale of its voice  communications
business unit to Fairfield,  New Jersey-based Phonextra,  Inc. for approximately
$2,017,000,  half of which was paid in cash at the close of the  transaction and
the balance of which was paid in the form of a promissory  note  self-amortizing
over one year. The Company's sale of its voice  communications unit was aimed at
enabling  it to  sharpen  its focus on video  solutions  and on  Glowpoint,  its
subscriber-based  IP network  dedicated to video  communications  traffic.  As a
consequence,  this unit has been  classified as a discontinued  operation in the
financial  statements,  with its net assets at December  31, 2000 and results of
operations  summarized in single line items on the  Company's  balance sheet and
statements of operations.


Net assets of discontinued operations consists of the following:

Bank loan payable

In June 2000,  the Company  entered into a $15,000,0000  working  capital credit

this  facility  loan  availability  is based on up to 75% of  eligible  accounts
receivable  and 50% of  inventory,  subject to an inventory  cap of  $5,000,000.
Borrowings  bear  interest  at the  lender's  base rate plus 1/2% per annum.  At
December 31, 2001,  the  interest  rate on the facility was 5.25%.  The facility
contains  certain  financial  and  operational  covenants.  For the period  from
October 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001 ("2001 Fourth  Quarter"),  the Company
was in  violation of the  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and
amortization   ("EBITDA")  and  interest  coverage  ratio  covenants  under  the
facility.  On March 26,  2002,  the  Company  received a waiver  from the lender
regarding these requirements for the 2001 Fourth Quarter.  At December 31, 2001,
amounts outstanding under the facility were $10,628,082 and have been classified
as a current liability due to the maturity of the facility in June 2002.

Note 7 -- Stockholders' Equity

Initial Public Offering

In May 1997, the Company  completed a public offering of 805,000 Units for $7.00
per Unit.  Each Unit  consisted of two shares of Common Stock and two Redeemable
Class A Warrants.  The Warrants are  exercisable  for four years  commencing one
year from the effective date of the offering, at a price of $4.25 per share. The
Company  may  redeem the  Warrants  at a price of $.10 per  warrant,  commencing
eighteen  months from the effective  date of the offering and  continuing  for a
four-year period, provided the price of the Company's Common Stock is $10.63 for
at least 20  consecutive  trading days prior to issuing a notice of  redemption.
The Company received proceeds from the offering of approximately $4,540,000, net
of related costs of registration.

On  February  10,  2000,  the  Company  announced  its  intention  to redeem all
outstanding  Class A warrants.  From February  through  April 2000,  the Company
raised net proceeds of  approximately  $8,047,000 from the exercise of 1,933,647
Class A warrants.  All unexercised Class A warrants were redeemed in April 2000,
except  for  112,000  Class A warrants  underlying  the  options  granted to the
underwriters.

The Company also issued to the underwriter of the public  offering,  for nominal
consideration,  an  option  to  purchase  up to  70,000  Units.  This  option is
exercisable for a four-year  period  commencing one year from the effective date
of the offering,  at a per Unit exercise  price of $8.40 per Unit. The Units are
similar to those  offered to the  public.  In March 2000,  the Company  received
$117,600 from the exercise of 28,000 Units.

Common Stock

In August  2001,  the Company  raised net  proceeds of $9.9 million in a private
placement of 2,200,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.00 per share.
Investors in the private placement also received  five-year warrants to purchase
814,000  shares of common  stock at an  exercise  price of $6.25 per share.  The
warrants  are subject to certain  anti-dilution  protection.  The  Company  also
issued to its placement agent five-year  warrants to purchase  220,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share.

Preferred Stock

In December  1996,  the  Company's  stockholders  approved an  amendment  to the
Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  to  authorize  the  issuance of up to
1,000,000  shares  of  Preferred  Stock.  The  authorized  number  of  shares of
Preferred Stock to be issued was raised to 5,000,000  shares  effective with the
merger with VTI.  Except for the 2,450 shares of Series A preferred stock issued
in June 2000, the rights and privileges of the Preferred Stock have not yet been
designated.

In June 2000,  the Company  raised gross proceeds of $17.15 million in a private
placement  of 2,450  shares  of  Series  A  mandatorily  redeemable  convertible
preferred  stock.  The preferred  shares were  convertible  into up to 2,450,000
shares of common  stock at a price of $7.00 per share,  subject  to  adjustment.
Beginning on June 14, 2001,  the preferred  stockholders  were able to choose an
alternative  conversion  price which  equaled the higher of (i) 70% of the fixed
conversion price then in effect or (ii) the market price on any conversion date,
which was equal to the  average  of the  closing  sale  prices of the  Company's
common stock during the 20 consecutive  trading days  immediately  preceding any
conversion date. Preferred stockholders were able, at their sole option, to have
their shares  redeemed on the earlier of three years from the issuance  date, or
the occurrence of a triggering event, as defined.


                                      F-11
                                      <page>
                                       The redemption  price was 110% of the stated value of $7,000 per share.  None of
the triggering  events has occurred to date.  Investors in the private placement
also received five-year warrants to purchase a total of 857,500 shares of common
stock for $10.50 per share.  The warrants  are subject to certain  anti-dilution
privileges.  The  Company  has  valued  the  warrants  at  $3,740,000  using the
Black-Scholes  pricing  model.  The Company also issued to its  placement  agent
warrants to purchase  193,748  shares of common  stock for $7.00 per share,  and
warrants to purchase  67,876  shares of common  stock for $10.50 per share.  The
warrants  expire on June 14,  2005.  The  Company  has  valued the  warrants  at
$1,410,000  using the  Black-Scholes  pricing  model.  At the issuance date, the
Company  recorded a deemed  dividend and an  offsetting  increase in  additional
paid-in  capital  of  approximately  $8.1  million  to  reflect  the  beneficial
conversion feature of the preferred stock. During the fourth quarter of 2000, in
accordance  with EITF No.  00-27,  the  Company  recorded an  additional  deemed
dividend of $3.9  million to reflect the  beneficial  conversion  feature of the
warrants.

Costs of the  offering,  including  the  fair  value  of the  warrants,  totaled
$6,150,000. This amount was recorded as a preferred stock discount and was being
amortized  as a deemed  dividend  over the  three-year  period  from the date of
issuance to the June 2003  redemption  date.  In  addition,  the 10%  redemption
premium of $1,715,000 was being accreted as a deemed  dividend into the carrying
value of the Series A mandatorily  redeemable  convertible  preferred stock over
the same period.

The stockholders of Wire One  Technologies,  Inc. were asked, in accordance with
the requirements of Rule  4350(i)(1)(D) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the "Rule"),
and approved,  at the 2001 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders,  the issuance by the
Company  of more  than  20% of its  common  stock  upon  the  conversion  of the
Company's  series A preferred  and  exercise of the related  warrants.  The Rule
restricted the Company from issuing more 20% of its outstanding shares of common
stock at less than market value in any transaction  unless the Company  obtained
prior  stockholder  approval (the "Exchange Cap"). As a consequence of receiving
this  approval,  the  Company was able to issue  3,021,429  shares of its common
stock upon  conversion of the remaining 2,115 shares of Series A preferred stock
outstanding when,  beginning on June 14, 2001, each remaining holder of series A
preferred  substituted  an  "alternative  conversion  price" for the $7.00 fixed
conversion price. The alternative conversion price was equal to 70% of the fixed
conversion price then in effect.

Note 8 -- Stock Options

Wire One 2000 Stock Incentive Plan

In  September  2000,  the Company  adopted and  approved the Wire One 2000 Stock
Incentive  Plan (the "2000 Plan").  The 2000 Plan permits the grant of incentive
stock  options   ("ISOs")  to  employees  or  employees  of  its   subsidiaries.
Non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs") may be granted to employees, directors and
consultants.  The Company  issued  2,227,450  options  during 2001 with exercise
prices  ranging  from $1.94 to $5.50 and vesting  periods  ranging from three to
four years.  As of December 31,  2001,  options to purchase a total of 2,638,118
shares  were  outstanding  and  361,882  shares  remained  available  for future
issuance under the 2000 Plan.

The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of options,  including ISOs,  NQSOs,  stock
appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights,  restricted stock,  performance


                                      F-12
                                       <page>
                                        units,  performance shares or any combination thereof (collectively,  "Awards").
The exercise price of the Awards is established by the administrator of the plan
and, in the case of ISO's the per share exercise price must be equal to at least
100% of fair market  value of a share of the common  stock on the date of grant.
The  administrator of the plan determines the terms and provisions of each award
granted  under  the  2000  Plan,  including  the  vesting  schedule,  repurchase
provisions,  rights of first refusal,  forfeiture  provisions,  form of payment,
payment  contingencies and satisfaction of any performance  criteria.  Under the
2000 Plan, no individual will be granted ISO's  corresponding  to shares with an
aggregate  exercise  price in excess of $100,000 in any  calendar  year less the
aggregate  exercise price of shares under other Company stock options granted to
that  individual  that vests in such calendar year. The 2000 Plan will terminate
in 2010.

Non-qualified options

The Company issued a total of 167,500,  70,125 and 817,473 options,  outside the
context of a stock option  plan,  during 2001,  2000 and 1999  respectively,  to
various employees,  directors,  and advisors,  with exercise prices ranging from
$3.81 to $9.85 per share and immediate vesting.  At December 31, 2001, the total
outstanding  non-qualified options of this nature were 2,244,427.  The number of
options have been  adjusted to reflect the 1.65 to 1 conversion  rate  resulting
from the May 18, 2000 merger with VTI.

1996 Stock Option Plan

In December 1996, the Board of Directors adopted the Company's Stock Option Plan
(the "1996 Plan") and reserved up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance
thereunder.  In June 1998, the Company's  shareholders  approved an amendment to
the 1996  Plan  increasing  the  amount of  shares  available  under the plan to
2,475,000.  The 1996 Plan  provides  for the  granting  of options to  officers,
directors,  employees  and  advisors  of the  Company.  The  exercise  price  of
incentive  stock  options  ("ISOs")  issued to  employees  who are less than 10%
stockholders  shall not be less  than the fair  market  value of the  underlying
shares on the date of grant or not less than  110% of the fair  market  value of
the shares in the case of an employee  who is a 10%  stockholder.  The  exercise
price of  restricted  stock  options shall not be less than the par value of the
shares to which the option relates.  Options are not exercisable for a period of
one year from the date of grant.  Under the 1996  Plan,  no  individual  will be
granted ISO's corresponding to shares with an aggregate exercise price in excess
of $100,000 in any calendar  year less the  aggregate  exercise  price of shares
under other Company stock options  granted to that  individual that vest in such
calendar year. The 1996 Plan will terminate in 2006.  Options  granted under the
1996 Plan in 2001,  2000, and 1999 were 0, 334,848 and 1,393,527,  respectively.
As of December  31, 2001,  options to purchase a total of 1,029,320  shares were
outstanding and no shares remained  available for future issuance under the 1996
Plan.  The  number  of  options  have been  adjusted  to  reflect  the 1.65 to 1
conversion rate resulting from the merger with VTI.

VTI Stock Option Plans

As part of the merger with VTI, the Company assumed the  outstanding  options of
the four stock option plans maintained by VTI. These plans generally require the
exercise price of options to be not less than the estimated fair market value of
the stock at the date of grant. Options vest over a maximum period of four years
and may be  exercised  in  varying  amounts  over  their  respective  terms.  In
accordance  with the provisions of such plans,  all  outstanding  options become
immediately  exercisable upon a change of control,  as defined,  of VTI. VTI had
authorized  an  aggregate  of  1,161,000  shares of common stock to be available
under all the current option plans.  The plans will  terminate in 2009.  Options
assumed as part of the merger with VTI totaled  361,605.  Options  granted under
these  Plans  in 2001 and 2000  (since  the  merger  date)  were 0 and  189,503,
respectively.  As of December 31,  2001,  options to purchase a total of 371,077
shares were  outstanding and no shares remained  available for future  issuance.
The  options  have been  adjusted  to reflect  the 2 for 1 reverse  stock  split
approved by the VTI Board of Directors concurrent with the merger with ACC.

                                         The Company has elected to use the intrinsic  value-based  method of APB Opinion
No.  25 to  account  for all of its  employee  stock-based  compensation  plans.
Accordingly,  no  compensation  cost has  been  recognized  in the  accompanying
financial  statements for stock options issued to employees because the exercise
price of each option equals or exceeds the fair value of the  underlying  common
stock as of the grant date for each stock  option.  The  weighted-average  grant
date  fair  value of  options  granted  during  2001,  2000 and 1999  under  the
Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  was  $2.70,  $2.03  and $.56 per  option,
respectively.

During the 2001 period,  management  established a valuation allowance to offset
the benefits of significant  temporary tax differences due to the uncertainty of
their realization.  These deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating
losses carried  forward in the VTI merger,  reserves and  allowances,  and stock
based compensation. If the tax benefits currently offset by valuation allowances
are  subsequently  realized,  approximately  $7.9  million  will be  credited to
goodwill  because  these  tax  benefits  relate to VTI  operations  prior to the
merger. In addition,  approximately  $2.2 million will be credited to additional
paid-in   capital   because  these  tax  benefits  relate  to  the  exercise  of
non-qualified  stock options and  disqualifying  dispositions of incentive stock
options.

The Company and its  subsidiaries  file federal returns on a consolidated  basis
and  separate  state tax  returns.  At December  31,  2001,  the Company has net
operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards of approximately $30 million and $26 million
for federal and state income tax purposes,  respectively.  The federal NOL has a
carryover  period of 20 years and is available to offset future taxable  income,
if  any,  through  2021.  The  utilization  of  the  $30  million  in  tax  loss
carryforwards is limited to approximately  $2.4 million each year as a result of
an "ownership change" (as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended), which occurred in 2000.

operating  costs and repairs over certain base year amounts.  Lease payments for
the  years  ended   December  31,  2001,   2000  and  1999  were   approximately

Legal Matters

In September 1997, the Company entered into an exclusive  distribution agreement
with Maxbase,  Inc.  ("Maxbase"),  the  manufacturer of "MaxShare 2," a patented
bandwidth-on-demand  line-sharing  device.  The Company  identified  performance
problems with the MaxShare 2 product in certain applications,  and believed that
MaxBase had a contractual  obligation  to correct any  technical  defects in the
product.

In July, 1998,  MaxBase filed a complaint  against the Company alleging that the
Company had failed to meet its required minimum purchase obligations thereunder.
Maxbase claimed damages of approximately  $1,350,000 in lost profits, as well as
unspecified  punitive  and  treble  damages.  The  Company  filed  a  number  of
counterclaims, which were dismissed by the court.

In February 2001,  the court granted  Maxbase's  motion for summary  judgment on
liability for breach of contract,  and the plaintiff subsequently dropped all of
its other claims. The court, following a trial to determine damages,  entered an
approximately  $745,000 judgment in favor of Maxbase.  After filing an appeal of
that judgment,  the Company determined in December 2001 that it would be able to
settle the case for  $625,000,  accrued an  additional  $375,000  in  litigation
reserves in 2001 and  formally  settled the case in early 2002.  The  additional
litigation reserves were recorded in general and administrative  expenses in the
statement of operations.

                                              The Company is defending several other suits or claims in the ordinary course of
business,  none of which  individually  or in the  aggregate  is material to the
Company's business,  financial  condition or results of operations.

Note 11 -- Pension Plan

On March 1, 1998 the  Company  adopted  a 401(k)  Retirement  Plan (the  "401(k)
Plan")  under  Section  401(k) of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  The 401(k) Plan
covered   substantially   all   employees   who  met  minimum  age  and  service
requirements.  The 401(k) Plan was  non-contributory on the part of the Company.
Effective with the merger with VTI, the Company  assumed the 401(k) Plan of VTI,
combined  its  assets  with  those  of  the  existing   plan  and  began  making
contributions  to the plan.  Employer  contributions  to the 401(k) Plan for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were approximately $83,000, $56,000
and $0, respectively.

Merger With View Tech, Inc.

On May 18, 2000 the merger of ACC and VTI was consummated in a transaction  that
has been accounted for as a "reverse acquisition" using the purchase method. The
reverse  acquisition  method resulted in ACC being recognized as the acquirer of
VTI for accounting and financial reporting purposes.

The value of VTI shares  exchanged was computed  using a five-day  average share
price with a midpoint of December 28, 1999, the date of the merger announcement.
The  number  of  shares  used in the  computation  is  based  on the VTI  shares
outstanding as of May 18, 2000.

with VTI during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  Such
amounts have been eliminated in preparing the pro forma information.

and an offsetting  increase in additional  paid-in capital of approximately $8.1
million to reflect the beneficial  conversion  feature of the Series A preferred
stock issued.  During the fourth  quarter of 2000,  in accordance  with EITF No.

reflect the beneficial conversion feature of the warrants (see Note 7).

Note 15 -- Subsequent Events

In January 2002,  the Company  raised net proceeds of $20.2 million in a private
placement of 3,526,500 shares of its common stock at a price of $6.25 per share.
Investors in the private placement also received  five-year warrants to purchase
864,375  shares of common  stock at an exercise  price of $10.00 per share.  The
warrants are subject to certain anti-dilution  protection.  $12.0 million of the
proceeds  from the  offering  were  used to pay down the bank  line of credit to
zero. The remaining proceeds will be used to fund the continuing development and
marketing  of the  Company's  Glowpoint  video  communications  network  and for
general corporate purposes.
