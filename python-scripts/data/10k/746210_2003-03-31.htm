Item 1.  Business

OVERVIEW

Wire One Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in May 2000 by
the merger of All Communications Corporation ("ACC"), a reseller and integrator
of video, voice and network communications design and service solutions into
View Tech, Inc. ("VTI"), a provider of video, voice and data communications
equipment and services.

Wire One is a leading single source provider of video communications solutions
that encompass the entire video communications value chain. We are a leading
integrator for major video communications equipment manufacturers, including the
number one market share leader, Polycom, Inc., as well as Tandberg, RADVision,
Cisco Systems, Sony and others. We integrate equipment from these manufacturers
into comprehensive video and network solutions and resell them to end users and
resellers. Our current customer base includes over 3,000 companies with
approximately 21,000 videoconferencing endpoints. We also operate our Glowpoint
network service, which provides our customers with two-way video communications
with high quality of service. With Glowpoint, which we believe to be the first
subscriber network to provide such communications by utilizing an Internet
network and broadband access dedicated solely to transporting video using the
H.323 Internet Protocol standard, we offer our customers a single point of
contact for all their video communications requirements.

Industry Overview

In today's fast-paced business environment, many companies seek more efficient
and cost effective ways to communicate with an increasingly mobile and widely
distributed network of employees, customers, suppliers and partners. Video
communications technology enables two or more parties in different locations to
use audio and video to communicate simultaneously in real time. Moreover, video
provides an effective means of communication that offers the benefit of
face-to-face interaction when participants are unable to meet in a common
location.

Historically, video communications involved point-to-point communication from
designated rooms equipped with large, expensive equipment. Users were forced to
tolerate cumbersome set-up procedures, which often required the assistance of a
trained technician. Moreover, bandwidth constraints and room availability often
limited the functionality, usability and reliability of these systems.

Video Communications Evolution

In recent years, video equipment manufacturers have been building smaller
devices and units for use with personal computers and also adopted standards to
help improve compatibility and user acceptance. Many of the older room systems
have been replaced as most users migrated to video communications systems based
upon Integrated Services Digital Network ("ISDN") standards. Although superior
to earlier technologies, ISDN still has several shortcomings, including high
transmission costs and poor quality of service ("QoS"), due primarily to the
fact that ISDN is fundamentally a narrowband technology. We believe that the low
quality and high cost of video communications using ISDN has impeded the growth
of the video communications market. More recently, the development of IP has
promised new standards for broadband communications, and the industry has
accordingly adopted IP-standards-based technologies that provide guaranteed QoS
and lower transmission costs than ISDN. We expect the ability to perform video
communications over IP will increase user adoption and help make two-way video
communications widespread in the enterprise and, ultimately, the consumer
markets.


                                       1
           <page>
            IP-based Video Communications

While many business users have private networks that could theoretically support
IP video communications, most are reluctant to run a video communications
application over the same networks that also support enterprise data and other
applications. Among other concerns, the video communications application would
be required to share bandwidth with data applications (for example, e-mail and
file transfers) on the common network. Allocating enough bandwidth in a
corporate local area network ("LAN") or intranet to handle real-time
transmission of sounds and images in addition to such data applications is
difficult and can create congestion that impedes overall network performance. In
addition, most businesses already find it difficult to effectively maintain and
manage existing applications due to the shortage of information technology and
network personnel. As a result, businesses increasingly require a solution
employing a network dedicated to video, which enables them to manage video
communications isolated from their other applications and existing
communications infrastructure.

An effective video network must also be easily scalable in much the same way
that a company can simply add more phone lines as its employee base and
operations grow. Moreover, widespread adoption by both enterprise and consumer
users requires a video communications solution that provides the same
reliability as public telephone service. We believe that there exists a
significant opportunity to provide an IP-based video communications solution
that is as scalable, dependable and, ultimately, as commonplace as voice
telephony.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We are a single source provider of video products and services that assists
customers located principally in the United States with systems design and
engineering, procurement, installation, operation and maintenance of their video
communications systems. We offer our customers video communications products
from leading manufacturers such as Polycom (which distributes products under the
Polycom, PictureTel and Accord brands, among others), Tandberg, RADVision, Cisco
Systems and Sony and provide a comprehensive suite of video and data services
including engineering, installation, customized training, on-site technical
assistance and maintenance. We also operate our Glowpoint network subscriber
service, which provides our customers with two-way video communications with
high quality of service utilizing a dedicated Internet Protocol ("IP") backbone
and broadband access. Lastly, we sell multi-point video and audio bridging
services through our Multiview Network Services program. We employ
state-of-the-art conferencing servers that provide seamless connectivity for all
switched digital networks.

Video Communications and Data Products

We market and sell a full range of video, audio and data products and systems
from Polycom, Tandberg, VCON Telecommunications, Ltd., Sony Electronics, Inc.,
Gentner Communications, Inc. and Extron Electronics, Inc. principally in the
United States. We also distribute data products from companies such as Adtran,
Lucent, Initia and RADVision to provide our customers with remote access into
LANs, permitting them to acquire bandwidth on demand and to digitally transmit
data. We configure single- or multi-vendor video and data conferencing platforms
for our clients and integrate systems and components into a complete solution
designed to suit each customer's particular communications requirements.

            <page>
             Video Communications Services

After designing a customer's video communications solution, we deliver, install
and test the communications equipment. When the system is functional, we provide
training to all levels of our customer's organization, including executives,
managers, management information systems and data-processing administrators and
technical staff. Training includes instruction in system operation, as well as
the planning and administration of meetings. By means of thorough training, we
help to ensure that our customers understand the functionality of their systems
and are able to apply the technology effectively.

Our OneCare service covers a customer's entire video communications system
deployment for a fixed fee. OneCare encompasses installation and maintenance
services that provide comprehensive customer support after the sale and help
ensure that our customers experience reliable, effortless video communications.
Our installation service places minimal demands on a customer's time and
resources. Our maintenance service provides technical support representatives
and engineers, a help desk offering 24x7 responsiveness, nationwide on-site
diagnostic repair and replacement service, nationwide network trouble
coordination and a video test facility.

We also provide advanced telecommunications consulting and engineering services
through our ProServices department. Our engineers have in-depth experience with
networks, microprocessors, software development and IT management, as well as
the design, deployment and repair of video telecommunications products and
technology. Our engineers use this experience to provide expert advice and
assistance in evaluating and deploying the appropriate visual communications
technology to meet a customer's project goals and objectives. These services
include application consulting and network design, laboratory testing, product
application and industry research, and technology trial assistance.

We also sell multi-point video and audio bridging services through our Multiview
Network Services program. We employ state-of-the-art conferencing servers that
provide seamless connectivity for all switched digital networks at an affordable
rate. Because of the significant expense associated with procuring multi-point
conferencing equipment, our customers typically elect instead to use our
Multiview Network Services as and when bridging is required.

Glowpoint

Our Glowpoint network provides customers with a high-quality platform for video
communications over IP and related applications. The Glowpoint service offers
subscribers substantially reduced transmission costs and superior video
communications quality, remote management of all videoconferencing endpoints
utilizing simple network management protocol ("SNMP"), gateway services to
ISDN-based video communications equipment, video streaming and store-and-forward
applications from our network operations center ("NOC").

To provide our Glowpoint service, we have contracted with MCI/WorldCom
Communications and Cable &amp; Wireless for access to their IP backbone networks and
co-location facilities. We have contracted with WorldCom, Covad Communications,
New Edge Networks, Allegiance Telecom and others, and plan to contract with
additional broadband access providers, for dedicated broadband access to the
Glowpoint network using either digital subscriber lines ("DSL"), or dedicated
1.5 Mbps ("T1") or 45 Mbps ("T3") lines. Products manufactured by a number of
leading IP video communications and video networking equipment suppliers,
including Polycom, Tandberg, RADVision, Cisco Systems and Sony are compatible
with Glowpoint.

SALES AND MARKETING

We market and sell our products and services to the commercial, government,
medical and educational sectors through a direct sales force of account
executives as well as through resellers. Sales to resellers are made on terms
with respect to pricing, payment and returns that are consistent with those
offered to end user customers. No price protection or similar arrangement is
offered, nor are the obligations as to payment contingent on the resale of the
equipment purchased by the reseller. There are no special rights to return
equipment granted to resellers, nor are we obligated to repurchase reseller
inventory. These efforts are supported by sales engineers, a marketing
department and a professional services and engineering group. As of December 31,
2002, we had 61 account executives and 31 additional sales management,
engineering, administrative and marketing personnel.


                                       3
             <page>
              Our marketing department concentrates on activities that will generate leads for
our sales force and create brand awareness for Wire One and the Glowpoint
network, including direct marketing campaigns, select advertising, public
relations, participation in trade shows and the coordination of seminars
throughout the country. We host these seminars to demonstrate video
communications systems to prospective customers and to educate them on
technological advancements in video and data communications. We also provide our
sales force with ongoing training to ensure that it has the necessary expertise
to effectively market and promote our business and solutions.

In conjunction with manufacturer-sponsored programs, we provide existing and
prospective customers with sales, advertising and promotional materials. We
maintain up-to-date systems for demonstration purposes in all of our sales
offices and demonstration facilities.

Our technical and training personnel periodically attend installation and
service training sessions offered by video communications manufacturers to
enhance their knowledge and expertise in the installation and maintenance of the
systems.

CUSTOMERS

We have sold our products and services to over 3,000 customers, which
collectively have approximately 21,000 videoconferencing endpoints. These
customers operate in each of the following market sectors: commercial, medical,
educational and governmental. No single customer accounts for more than 5% of
our revenues. We maintained a backlog of firm sales orders with related revenue
totaling $1.1 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. We expect that the sales orders in the backlog at December 31,
2002 will be fulfilled within the current fiscal year. The size of the backlog
varies depending on the nature of the equipment underlying the sales orders and
whether or not the orders are received with enough time available to procure and
ship the equipment prior to the end of the fiscal period.

TECHNOLOGY

The Glowpoint network

Glowpoint employs a proprietary network architecture consisting of
state-of-the-art equipment co-located at WorldCom and Cable &amp; Wireless data
centers across the country, each one constituting a Glowpoint point of presence
("POP"), and dedicated capacity on WorldCom's and Cable &amp; Wireless' high
performance, redundant backbones. This backbone network connects all of
Glowpoint's POPs, using multiple high-speed OC-3 and OC-12 lines, which
virtually eliminate the risk of a single point of failure. Our POPs consist of
the best available technology from multiple vendors combined in a proprietary
architecture and co-located in a secure and monitored environment. This
configuration of equipment at the POPs and their locations distributed across
the country is expected to provide industry-leading throughput, scalability and
mission-critical resiliency. All equipment on the network complies with current
H.323 (IP) standards.

Currently, we have 13 POPs strategically located throughout the United States,
as well as in the UK, Canada and Japan. We have contracted with WorldCom, Covad,
Allegiance Telecom and others, and plan to contract with additional broadband
access providers, for dedicated broadband access to the Glowpoint network using
either DSL, T1 or T3.

Network operations center

We maintain a state-of-the-art NOC at our headquarters from which we monitor the
operations of Glowpoint on a 24x7 basis. The NOC's primary functions are to
monitor the network, manage and support all backbone equipment, provide usage
information for billing, provide utilization data for capacity planning and
provide value-added customer services. Only usage information and authentication
packets, rather than actual video communications traffic, passes through the
NOC. Technology in the NOC includes gatekeepers, routers and switches, servers,
firewalls and load-balancing devices. The NOC uses redundant circuits to connect
directly to our backbone.

              <page>
               Research and Development

As of December 31, 2002, we employed a staff of 12 software and hardware
engineers who evaluate, test and develop proprietary applications. The costs of
this team of engineers in the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled approximately
$1 million. In the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the costs related to
this team of engineers totaled $1 million and $120,000, respectively. To augment
these resources, we engage independent consultants from time-to-time. We expect
that we will continue to commit resources to research and development in the
future to further develop our proprietary network solution.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2002, we had 328 full-time employees. Of these employees, 241
are employed in our video solutions segment (comprised of 92 sales account
executives, engineers, management, administrative and marketing personnel; 66
audio/visual integration employees; 58 employees involved in providing
installation and maintenance services, technical services and customer support;
and 25 employees in order processing and fulfillment); 48 are employed in our
network solutions segment; and the remaining 39 are employed in corporate
functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe
that our employee relations are good.

COMPETITION

We compete primarily with manufacturers and resellers of video communications
systems, some of which are larger, have longer operating histories and have
greater financial resources and industry recognition than us. These competitors
include FVC.com, Tandberg and VTEL Corporation.

We also compete with providers of video communications transport services,
including AT&amp;T Corporation, WorldCom, Sprint Corporation and some other of the
regional Bell operating companies and carriers. In the future, competition may
increase from new and existing resellers, from manufacturers that choose to sell
direct to end users and from existing and new telecommunications services
providers, which may include certain of our suppliers or network providers, many
of which have greater financial resources than we do.

We compete primarily on the basis of our:

     o   sole focus on the video communications industry;

     o   breadth of video product and service offerings;

     o   relationships with video equipment manufacturers;

     o   nationwide presence;

     o   technical expertise;

     o   knowledgeable sales, service and training personnel; and

     o   commitment to customer service and support.

We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of
factors both within and outside our control, including the adoption and
evolution of technologies relating to our business, the pricing policies of our
competitors and suppliers, our ability to hire and retain key technical and
management personnel and industry and general economic conditions.

                    Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form
10-K. All statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including,
but not limited to, statements regarding anticipated future capital
requirements, our future development plans, our ability to obtain debt, equity
or other financing, and our ability to generate cash from operations, are based
on current expectations. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not
be construed to imply any conclusion that such results or trends will
necessarily continue in the future.

The statements contained herein, other than historical information, are or may
be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and involve factors, risks and uncertainties
that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from
such statements. These factors, risks and uncertainties, include our relatively
short operating history; market acceptance and availability of new products and
services; the terminable-at-will and nonexclusive nature of reseller agreements
with manufacturers; rapid technological change affecting products and services
sold by us; the impact of competitive products, services, and pricing, as well
as competition from other resellers and service providers; possible delays in
the shipment of new products; and the availability of sufficient financial
resources to enable us to expand its operations.

Overview

Wire One is a single source provider of video products and services that assists
customers located principally in the United States with systems design and
engineering, procurement, installation, operation and maintenance of their video
communications systems. We offer our customers video communications products
from leading manufacturers such as Polycom (which distributes products under the
Polycom, PictureTel and Accord brands, among others), Tandberg, RADVision, Cisco
Systems and Sony and provide a comprehensive suite of video and data services
including engineering, installation, customized training, on-site technical
assistance and maintenance. We also operate our Glowpoint network subscriber
service, which provides our customers with two-way video communications with
high quality of service utilizing an Internet network and broadband access
dedicated solely to transporting video using the H.323 IP standard. Lastly, we
sell multi-point video and audio bridging services through our Multiview Network
Services program. We employ state-of-the-art conferencing servers that provide
seamless connectivity for all switched digital networks.

We market and sell products and services to the commercial, government, medical
and educational sectors through a direct sales force of account executives as
well as through resellers. Sales to resellers are made on terms with respect to
pricing, payment and returns that are consistent with those offered to end user
customers. No price protection or similar arrangement is offered, nor are the
obligations as to payment contingent on the resale of the equipment purchased by
the reseller. There are no special rights to return equipment granted to
resellers, nor are we obligated to repurchase reseller inventory. These efforts
are supported by sales engineers, a marketing department, and a professional
services and engineering group. We have sold our products and services to over
3,000 customers who collectively have approximately 21,000 videoconferencing
endpoints.

Product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of video communications
equipment and is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that the price is
fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain, collectibility is
probable and returns are estimable. Revenue is recognized at the time of
shipment since the terms of shipment are FOB shipping point and legal title to
the equipment passes to the customer at this time. Post shipment obligations
such as installation and training are considered relatively insignificant given
the underlying nature of the equipment and of its installation.

Service revenue is derived from services rendered in connection with the sale of
new systems and the maintenance of previously installed systems. Services
rendered in connection with the sale of new systems consist of engineering
services related to system integration, installation, technical training and
user training. Most of these services are rendered at or prior to installation
and all revenue is recognized only after the services have been rendered.
Revenue related to extended service contracts is deferred and recognized over
the life of the extended service period. Revenue related to the Glowpoint
network subscriber service and the multi-point video and audio bridging services
we offer are recognized through a monthly billing process after services have
been rendered.

Wire One was formed on May 18, 2000 by the merger of ACC and VTI. VTI was the
surviving legal entity in the merger. However, for financial reporting purposes,
the merger has been accounted for as a "reverse acquisition" using the purchase
method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, ACC's historical
results have been carried forward and VTI's operations have been included in the
financial statements commencing on the merger date. Accordingly, all 1999
results as well as 2000 results through the merger date are those of ACC only.
Further, on the date of the merger, the assets and liabilities of VTI were
recorded at their fair values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated
to goodwill.

In July 2000, we acquired the net assets of 2CONFER, LLC, a Chicago-based
provider of videoconferencing, audio and data solutions. The total consideration
was $800,000, consisting of $500,000 in cash and the remainder in our common
stock valued at the time of acquisition at $300,000. On the date of the
acquisition, the assets and liabilities of 2CONFER were recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

                     In October 2000, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Johns
Brook Company ("JBC") videoconferencing division, a New Jersey-based provider of
videoconferencing solutions. The total consideration was $635,000, consisting of
$481,000 in cash and the remainder in our common stock valued at the time of
acquisition at $154,000. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and certain
liabilities of the JBC videoconferencing division were recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

In June 2001, we acquired the assets of GeoVideo Networks, Inc., a New
York-based developer of video communications software. Chief among the assets,
in addition to GeoVideo's cash on hand of $2,500,000, was GeoVideo's browser, a
software tool based upon proprietary Bell Labs technology that allows up to six
simultaneous, real-time, bi-directional high-bandwidth IP video sessions to be
conducted over a standard desktop PC. In exchange for the acquired assets, we
issued 815,661 shares of our common stock, together with warrants to purchase
501,733 additional shares of our common stock at $5.50 per share and 520,123
shares at $7.50 per share. On the date of acquisition the assets of GeoVideo
were recorded at their fair values, with the excess purchase consideration
allocated to goodwill.

In July 2001, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of Advanced
Acoustical Concepts, Inc. ("AAC"), an Ohio-based designer of audiovisual
conferencing systems. The total consideration was $794,000, which was paid in
the form of our common stock valued at the time of acquisition. On the date of
acquisition, the assets and certain liabilities were recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

In October 2001, we completed the sale of our voice communications business unit
to Fairfield, New Jersey-based Phonextra, Inc. for approximately $2,017,000,
half of which was paid in cash at the close of the transaction and the balance
of which was paid in the form of a promissory note requiring equal periodic
payments of principal and interest over its one year term. The sale of our voice
communications unit was aimed at enabling us to sharpen our focus on video
solutions and on Glowpoint, our subscriber-based IP network dedicated to video
communications traffic. As a consequence, this unit has been classified as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements, with its
results from operations summarized in a single line item on our statement of
operations.

In November 2001, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of the video
conferencing division of Axxis, Inc., a Kentucky-based designer of audiovisual
conferencing systems. The total consideration was $2,051,000, which was paid in
the form of our common stock valued at the time of acquisition. On the date of
acquisition, the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

In March 2003, we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the
Audio-Visual ("AV") component to Columbia, Maryland-based Signal Perfection
Limited ("SPL") for approximately $807,000, $250,000 of which was paid in cash
at the close of the transaction and the balance of which was paid in the form of
a promissory note payable in five equal consecutive monthly payments commencing
on April 15, 2003. The sale of our AV component was aimed at enabling us to
focus more of our resources on the development and marketing of our Glowpoint
network, and to our video solutions business. As a consequence, this unit has
been classified as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial
statements, with its net assets summarized in a single line item on our
consolidated balance sheets and its results from operations summarized in a
single line item on our consolidated statements of operations. See footnote 4 to
the consolidated financial statements for further information.

                      Year Ended December 31, 2002 ("2002 period") Compared to Year Ended December 31,
2001 ("2001 period").

     NET REVENUES. We reported total net revenues of $82.7 million for the 2002
period, an increase of $8.3 million, or 11%, over the $74.4 million in revenues
reported for the 2001 period. This revenue growth was achieved despite operating
in what was a very challenging information technology and telecom spending
environment. Sales of video communications products amounted to 74% of total net
revenues in the 2002 period, revenues related to video services totaled 19% and
video network revenues accounted for the remaining 7% of total net revenues.

                       Video solutions -- Sales of video communications products were $61.4
million in the 2002 period, an increase of $5.8 million, or 10%, over the $55.6
million in the 2001 period. We sold 4,821 videoconferencing endpoints in the
2002 period, an increase of 11% over the 4,345 endpoints sold in the 2001
period. In 2002, we were again named Polycom's Reseller of the Year. We added
Sony's new videoconferencing product to our multi-vendor platform and expanded
our relationship with Tandberg in an effort to diversify our product mix and
offer more hardware manufacturers to customers. The growth that we experienced
in the 2002 period resulted from sales to new customers, $7.9 million, offset
slightly by a decline in sales to existing customers of $2.1 million. In the
2002 period, approximately 40% of sales of video communications products were to
new customers. We experienced growth in the 2002 period in the following
sectors: commercial enterprises, $1.5 million, and governmental, $6.1
million; offset by declines in sales to medical institutions, $0.7 million and
educational institutions, $1.1 million. Revenues related to video services were
$15.8 million in the 2002 period, an increase of $0.5 million, or 3%, over the
$15.3 million in the 2001 period. The revenue growth experienced in the 2002
period resulted from a $0.3 million increase in on-site technical support
revenue as a result of our providing more on-site technicians to assist our
customers in managing their video enterprises and from increased installation
revenue of $0.2 million related to the increased product sales. Service contract
revenues were flat year to year, but as a result of increased efforts to sign up
existing customers for renewal contracts and positive momentum built in the
second half of the 2002 period, we expect that service contract revenues should
increase in the 2003 period.

     Video network -- Sales of video network services were $5.6 million in the
2002 period, an increase of $2.1 million, or 61%, over the $3.5 million in the
2001 period. $2.8 million of the $2.1 million increase in revenues for the 2002
period over the 2001 period related to growth in Glowpoint network services with
a $0.7 million decline in revenues from the H.320 bridging service accounting
for the remainder of the change in revenues. The growth in Glowpoint network
services revenue was the result of having on average 312 more video endpoints on
the network in the 2002 period versus the 2001 period and those endpoints
producing $660 per month in revenue (accounting for approximately $2.5 million
of the $2.8 million increase) and in having 590 endpoints installed on the
network in the 2002 period (accounting for $0.3 million of the increase). The
decline in H.320 bridging revenues is the result of: 1) several customers
purchasing equipment to enable their own multi-point video calling capability,
$0.3 million of the decline; 2) year to year bridging service utilization
declines on the part of a number of existing customers, $0.3 million; and 3)
several customers transferring from H.320 bridging to IP bridging made possible
by the Glowpoint network, $0.1 million. These customers became Glowpoint
subscribers during the year and utilized the full range of Glowpoint services,
including IP bridging.

     GROSS MARGINS. Gross margins were $21.1 million in the 2002 period, a
decrease of $3.2 million over the 2001 period. Gross margins decreased in the
2002 period to 25.5% of net revenues, as compared to 32.6% of net revenues in
the 2001 period. The primary cause of the overall decline in gross margins was
the decline in gross margins on sales of video communications products. Gross
margins on sales of video communications products declined from 31.1% in the
2001 period to 22.8% in the 2002 period. This decrease is attributable to
overall competitive pressures in the video solutions market resulting from the
relatively weak economy, decreased spending for information technology and
telecom and downward pricing pressure initiated by competitors. Most video
communications products that we sell suffered year-over-year gross margin
declines. Gross margins related to video service revenues increased from 41.7%
in the 2001 period to 45.3% in the 2002 period. This increase is attributable to
cost reduction measures implemented in late July of 2002. These cost reductions
were the result of implementation of new management information systems that now
allow help desk calls from customers to be handled more efficiently and enable
us to better utilize our technicians. We expect the gross margins on sales of
video communications products to continue to be under pressure in the first half
of the 2003 period as a difficult economic environment persists, but anticipate
improvement in the second half of the 2003 period as economic uncertainties are
clarified, competitor video product inventory levels decline and new products
from manufacturers are introduced to the market.


                                       13
                       <page>
                        Gross margins related to video network revenues declined from 16.7% in the
2001 period to 0.0% in the 2002 period. The decline is the result of increased
fixed costs incurred in the 2002 period as the network has been built out to
handle the video traffic of over 2,000 video endpoints. At the end of the 2002
period there were 765 video endpoints on the network. Gross margins related to
video network revenues should improve over the course of the 2003 period as we
anticipate that more video endpoints will be installed on the network and
minimal further fixed costs related to the operation of the network are
incurred.

     SELLING. Selling expenses, which include sales salaries, commissions and
overhead and marketing costs, increased $3.6 million in the 2002 period to $25.7
million from $22.1 million for the 2001 period. Increases in selling expenses
are attributable to increases in the number of sales personnel and their related
costs such as commissions, facilities, travel and telecommunications which
totaled $2.0 million and the $1.0 million of additional personnel, facilities,
travel, marketing and telecommunications costs related to the Glowpoint
division. We began the 2001 period with 98 sales and marketing employees and
ended it with 100 personnel dedicated to these functions. The number of sales
and marketing employees increased to 121 by the mid-point of the 2002 period and
was subsequently reduced to 92 by the end of the 2002 period. Selling expenses
as a percentage of net revenues for the 2002 period were 31.0%, an increase of
1.3%, from 29.7% in the 2001 period. Selling costs of the Glowpoint division as
a percentage of revenues increased 1.6% from the 2001 period to the 2002 period
and remaining selling expenses as a percentage of revenue declined 0.3% for the
same period.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses decreased
$4.0 million in the 2002 period to $8.2 million as compared to $12.2 million for
the 2001 period. This category of expense was significantly impacted by
non-recurring charges that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2001. The
most significant of these 2001 charges was the $4.0 million non-cash charge
related to a five-year extension of certain stock options granted to our Chief
Executive Officer, the one-time non-cash charge of $630,000 for accelerated
amortization of Glowpoint-related capitalized costs and the $375,000 charge
related to the settlement of outstanding litigation. In the 2002 period a $0.2
million non-cash charge related to the one-year extension of certain stock
options granted to our Chief Operating Officer was incurred. If these one-time
charges are subtracted from their respective periods, adjusted general and
administrative expenses are $7.2 million for the 2001 period and $8.0 million
for the 2002 period. The $0.8 million increase in adjusted general
administrative expenses is due to a $0.3 million increase in bad debt expense, a
$0.2 million increase in depreciation on corporate-level assets and a $0.3
million increase in personnel expense. We began the 2001 period with 30 finance
and administrative employees and ended it with 38 personnel dedicated to these
functions. The number of finance and administrative employees was up slightly to
39 by the end of the 2002 period. Adjusted general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of net revenues for the 2002 period were 9.6%, a decrease of
0.1%, from 9.7% in the 2001 period.

     RESTRUCTURING. We recorded a restructuring charge of $960,000 in June of
the 2002 period. $500,000 of the charge was for employee termination costs that
relate to the 84 employees that were terminated following the implementation of
the cost savings plan. $460,000 of the charge was for facility exit costs that
relate to the closing or downsizing of 19 sales offices. The charge was taken as
part of a plan that has resulted in annual cost savings of $7 million.

     Specific measures included the following: 1) reducing our overall workforce
by 84 employees, or approximately 20% of our headcount at that time; 2)
minimizing existing facility lease obligations by closing, re-locating or
downsizing 19 of our U.S. regional sales offices; 3) implementing a salary
reduction program, including executive salary reductions of 10% for our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer; 4) enhancing operating
efficiencies by implementing new operating processes, management information
systems and technology; and 5) negotiating more favorable terms from numerous
service providers and other vendors supplying us with goods and services.


                                       14
                        <page>
                         The workforce reductions affected every area of our business including: 1)
audio-visual integration operations, including technicians and engineering
personnel; 2) video solutions operations, including field and help desk
technicians; 3) order processing and fulfillment, including consolidation of all
warehouse operations in Miamisburg, Ohio; 4) finance, accounting and information
technology; and 5) sales and marketing, including call center and administrative
personnel and account executives. The closing, re-locating and downsizing of
regional sales offices has left us with a continued nationwide presence through
our 24 sales offices and demonstration facilities. The new operating processes,
management information systems and technology that have been implemented have
enabled us to more efficiently originate, process and fulfill video
communications product sales orders and to deliver the full range of video
services that we have provided in the past. We have not changed our product and
service offerings in any way as a result of this cost savings plan. All of the
cost savings measures were implemented by September 30, 2002 with the most
significant measures implemented by early August of 2002. We achieved full
realization of these cost savings in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2002.

     IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Impairment
losses on goodwill and other long-lived assets were $41.4 million in the 2002
period as we implemented the provisions of Financial Account Standards Board
("FASB") Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("FAS142") and
Financial Account Standards Board Statement No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("FAS144"). Amortization of goodwill
recorded in the 2001 period was $2.7 million. An impairment loss of $40.0
million related to the goodwill of the Video Solutions reporting unit was
recorded in the 2002 period. This non-cash impairment charge was recognized for
the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value.
An impairment loss of $1.4 million related to long-lived assets was also
recorded in the 2002 period.

     OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSES. One component of this category, amortization of
deferred financing costs, increased to $123,000 in the 2002 period as compared
to $100,000 in the 2001 period. In addition, interest income decreased in the
2002 period to $72,000 as compared to $77,000 in the 2001 period. Interest
expense decreased in the 2002 period to $432,000 as compared to $598,000 in the
2001 period. The decline in interest expense resulted from having lower average
outstanding loan balances in the 2002 period versus the 2001 period and from the
lower level of interest rates that existed in the 2002 period versus the 2001
period.

     INCOME TAXES. During the 2002 period, as we had done in the 2001 period, we
established a valuation allowance to offset the benefits of significant
temporary tax differences due to the uncertainty of their realization. These
deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating losses carried forward in
the VTI merger, reserves and allowances, and stock-based compensation. Due to
the nature of the deferred tax assets, the related tax benefits, upon
realization, will be credited substantially to the goodwill asset or additional
paid-in capital, rather than to income tax expense.

     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. In the 2002 period, we treated our audio-visual
integration component as a discontinued operation because: 1) the operations and
cash flows of this component have been eliminated from our ongoing operations as
a result of a disposal transaction; and 2) we do not have any significant
continuing involvement in the operation of the component after the disposal
transaction. We incurred a loss from discontinued operations relating to the
audio-visual integration component in the 2002 period of $2.7 million and a $0.4
million loss in the 2001 period. In addition, as a result of several
post-closing adjustments related to the sale of its voice communications
business, we incurred a $0.3 million loss from this discontinued operation in
the 2002 period. We incurred a $0.6 million loss from discontinued operations in
the 2001 period which resulted from lower revenues to cover the fixed costs of
the voice communications unit and higher costs of revenues as competitive
pressures reduced gross margins.

     NET INCOME (LOSS). We reported a net loss attributable to common
stockholders for the 2002 period of $(58.6) million, or $(2.03) per diluted
share, as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(19.0)
million, or $(0.91) per diluted share for the 2001 period. The $(58.6) million
net loss for the 2002 period resulted primarily from $41.4 million of impairment
losses on goodwill and other long-lived assets, depreciation and amortization
charges of $5.1 million, non-cash compensation of $0.7 million, a $1.0 million
restructuring charge, $3.9 million of Glowpoint direct expenses and a $2.7
million loss from discontinued AV operations. EBITDA from continuing operations
for the 2002 period was $(6.9) million. The $(19.0) million net loss for the
2001 period resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization charges of
$7.1 million, non-cash compensation of $4.4 million, $4.4 million of deemed
dividends on Series A preferred stock, a $0.2 million restructuring charge, $2.9
million of Glowpoint direct expenses and a $0.4 million loss from discontinued
AV operations. EBITDA from continuing operations for the 2001 period was $(0.2)
million.

                          Year Ended December 31, 2001 ("2001 period") Compared to Year Ended December 31,
2000 ("2000 period").

     NET REVENUES. We reported net revenues of $74.4 million for the 2001
period, an increase of $26.0 million over the $48.4 million in revenues reported
for the 2000 period. Although the operations of acquired companies have now been
fully integrated, management estimates that revenues from the core businesses,
meaning the Company's video solutions and network solutions businesses, in
existence before contributions from acquired operations accounted for $16.3
million of the $26.0 million increase, or 62.7%, with acquisitions accounting
for $9.7 million of the increase, or 37.3%.

     Video solutions -- Sales of video communications products and services were
$70.9 million in the 2001 period, an increase of $24.0 million, or 51%, over the
$46.9 million in the 2000 period. Management estimates that approximately $15.2
million of the $24.0 million increase in revenues for the 2001 period over the
2000 period, or 63.3%, related to the core businesses in existence before
contributions from acquired operations and $8.8 million in revenues, or 36.7%,
from acquired operations accounted for the remainder of the growth. The growth
experienced in the 2001 period resulted from sales to both new and existing
customers in the commercial, governmental, medical and educational markets
throughout the United States.

     Video network -- Sales of video network services were $3.5 million in the
2001 period, an increase of $2.0 million, or 136%, over the $1.5 million in the
2000 period. This increase in revenues consisted of $0.4 million in revenues
resulting from the introduction of the Glowpoint network and $1.6 million in
revenues from the acquired H.320 bridging service of VTI.

     GROSS MARGINS. Gross margins were $24.3 million in the 2001 period, an
increase of $8.5 million from $15.8 million for the 2000 period. Gross margins
remained at 32.6% of net revenues for both the 2001 and 2000 periods. An
increase in the gross margins on video service from 31.4% in the 2000 period to
41.7% in the 2001 period helped to mitigate the decline in gross margins on
sales of video communications products from 33.1% in the 2000 period to 31.1% in
the 2001 period. The margin decline on sales of products was primarily caused by
the disproportionate amount of sales of high dollar, low-margin multipoint
bridge equipment in 2001 revenues.

     SELLING. Selling expenses, which include sales salaries, commissions,
overhead, and marketing costs, increased $9.5 million in the 2001 period to
$22.1 million from $12.6 million for the 2000 period. Increases in selling
expenses are attributable to increases in the number of sales personnel and
their related costs, such as commissions, facilities, travel and
telecommunications, which totaled $4.8 million, the costs of additional sales
offices resulting from acquisitions since May 2000 totaling $0.9 million and the
$2.5 million of personnel, facilities, travel, marketing and telecommunications
costs related to the Glowpoint division not yet covered by revenues. Selling
expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the 2001 period were 29.7%, an
increase from 26.0% in the 2000 period. This increase is primarily attributable
to the $2.5 million of expenses of the Glowpoint division, which amounted to
3.4% of net revenue.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses increased
$8.1 million in the 2001 period to $12.2 million as compared to $4.1 million for
the 2000 period. This category of expense was significantly impacted by
non-recurring charges that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2001. The
most significant of these charges were the $4.0 million charge related to a
five-year extension of certain stock options granted to our Chief Executive
Officer in 1997, the one-time non-cash charge of $630,000 for accelerated
amortization of Glowpoint-related capitalized costs and the $375,000 charge
related to the settlement of outstanding litigation. If these one-time charges
are subtracted from the 2001 period, adjusted general and administrative
expenses are $7.2 million in the 2001 period. The $3.1 million increase in
adjusted general and administrative expenses is due to a $0.4 million increase
in bad debt expense, a $0.7 million increase in depreciation on corporate-level
assets, a $0.8 million increase in personnel expense and a $0.5 million increase
in professional and other corporate fees. Adjusted general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the 2001 period were 9.7%, an
increase of 1.2%, from 8.5% in the 2000 period.

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL. Amortization of goodwill increased $1.2 million in the
2001 period to $2.7 million as compared to $1.5 million for the 2000 period. The
increase was the result of a full year of amortization related to the VTI,
2CONFER, and JBC acquisitions ($1.1 million of the increase) and goodwill
amortization related to the acquisition of GeoVideo of $0.1 million.

     OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSES. The principal component of this category,
amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased to $100,000 in the 2001
period as compared to $343,000 in the 2000 period. The decrease reflects the
absence from the 2001 period of the amortization of $305,000 related to the
issuance of warrants to former VTI subordinated debt holders. In addition
interest income decreased in the 2001 period to $77,000 as compared to $315,000
in the 2000 period. The decrease reflects decreased funds invested during the
2001 period as the capital raised in prior periods was deployed in operations.
Interest expense increased in the 2001 period to $598,000 as compared to $78,000
in the 2000 period. During the 2001 period we expanded our use of our line of
credit to fund our operations with the result being a significant increase in
interest expense.

                          <page>
                           INCOME TAXES. During the 2001 period, we established a valuation allowance
to offset the benefits of significant temporary tax differences due to the
uncertainty of their realization. These deferred tax assets consist primarily of
net operating losses carried forward in the VTI merger, reserves and allowances,
and stock-based compensation. Due to the nature of the deferred tax assets, the
related tax benefits, upon realization, will be credited substantially to the
goodwill asset or additional paid-in capital, rather than to income tax expense.

     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. We incurred a loss from discontinued AV operations
in the 2001 period of $396,000. Since the AV division evolved as a result of
2001 acquisitions, there is no corresponding activity in this component for the
2000 period. We incurred a loss from discontinued Voice division operations in
the 2001 period of $617,000 as compared to income from discontinued Voice
division operations in the 2000 period of $521,000. The decline in income from
discontinued Voice division operations resulted from lower revenues to cover the
fixed costs of the voice communications unit and higher costs of revenues as
competitive pressures reduced gross margins.

     NET LOSS. We reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for
the 2001 period of $(19.0) million, or $(0.91) per diluted share, as compared to
loss attributable to common stockholders of $(16.3) million, or $(1.27) per
diluted share for the 2000 period. Before giving effect to the aggregate $4.4
million in deemed dividends on Series A convertible preferred stock in the 2001
period and $13.7 million in deemed dividends in the 2000 period, we reported a
net loss of $(14.5) million for the 2001 period and $(2.5) million for the 2000
period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     At December 31, 2002, we had working capital of $24.9 million compared to
$15.6 million at December 31, 2001, an increase of approximately 59%. At
December 31, 2002, we had $2.8 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to
$1.7 million at December 31, 2001 (of which $900,000 was restricted as to its
use -- see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements). The $9.3
million increase in working capital resulted primarily from the January 2002
common stock offering of $20.3 million, the December 2002 convertible debenture
offering of $4.5 million, the net pay down of $4.8 million of bank loans and the
funding of the $11.3 million cash loss from operations in the 2002 period.

     In January 2002, we raised net proceeds of $20.3 million in a private
placement of 3,426,650 shares of our common stock at $6.25 per share. Investors
in the private placement also received five-year warrants to purchase 864,375
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share. The warrants
are subject to certain anti-dilution protection. $12 million of the proceeds
from the offering were used to pay down the bank line of credit to zero. The
remaining proceeds were used to fund the continuing development and marketing of
our Glowpoint video communications network and for general corporate purposes.

                            In May 2002, we entered into a $25 million working capital credit facility
with JPMorgan Chase Bank. Under terms of the three-year agreement for this
facility, loan availability is based on (1) 80% of eligible accounts receivable
and (2) the lesser of 50% against eligible finished goods inventory or 80%
against the net eligible amount of the net orderly liquidation value by category
of finished goods inventory as determined by an outside appraisal firm, subject
to an inventory cap of $2 million. Borrowings bear interest at the lender's base
rate plus 1 1/2 % per annum. At December 31, 2002, the interest rate on the
facility was 5.75%. The credit facility contains certain financial and
operational covenants. For the period from October 1, 2002 period through
December 31, 2002 ("2002 Fourth Quarter"), we were in violation of the covenant
requiring us to meet a certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA") target for the four quarters ended December 31, 2002. In
March 2003, we concluded an amendment to the credit facility with JPMorgan
Chase Bank to cure non-compliance with the EBITDA financial covenant arising
from the fourth quarter results. Some additional highlights of the amendment
include: 1) a reduction in the commitment amount of the line of credit from $25
million to $15 million; 2) revised EBITDA covenant levels for the remainder of
the term of the credit agreement; and, 3) maintenance of the interest rate, loan
fees and provisions of the borrowing formula at the same levels as previously
negotiated. At December 31, 2002, $5.8 million was outstanding under the
facility and the loan has been classified as non-current in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet because the facility matures in more than one year.

     In December 2002, we raised net proceeds of $4.6 million in a private
placement of $4,888,000 principal amount of 8% convertible debentures. The
debentures, which are convertible into 2,036,667 shares of common stock at $2.40
per share, are subordinate to our credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank. The
debentures mature in February 2004, or 90 days following the expiration (in May
2005) or earlier termination of the credit facility, whichever is later. We have
the option of paying interest on the debentures in the form of either cash or
Wire One common stock. The debentures will automatically convert into common
stock if Wire One shares trade above $4.80 for 10 consecutive trading days. If
we elect to prepay the debentures prior to maturity, the holders may instead
elect to convert the debentures into common stock, in which event the holders
will receive, in addition to the shares issuable upon the conversion, the
remaining interest payable under the debentures through maturity, payable in the
form of common stock based upon the conversion price. Investors in the private
placement also received five-year warrants to purchase 814,668 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share. The warrants are subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments. We also issued to its placement agent
warrants to purchase 40,733 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$0.001 per share and an expiration date of January 31, 2003.

     Net cash used in operating activities for the 2002 period was $14.0 million
as compared to net cash used by operations of $15.5 million during the 2001
period. The primary source of operating cash in 2002 was the net decrease in
accounts receivable of $10.0 million, which resulted from improved collection
efforts and lower fourth quarter sales in the current year versus the prior
year. We used this cash and cash raised through financing activities to fund
the $11.3 million cash loss from operations, $5.7 million in payments on

needed for audio-visual integration business and $2.4 million in inventory
purchases required for video solutions business.

                             Investing activities for the 2002 period included purchases of $1.3 million
for computer and demonstration equipment and leasehold improvements for the core
business and $3.4 million for computer, network and office equipment related to
the Glowpoint division. The Glowpoint network is currently built out to handle
the anticipated level of subscriptions for 2003. Although we anticipate current
expansion of the Glowpoint network and our core business, we have no significant
commitments to make capital expenditures for Glowpoint or the core business in
2003.

     Financing activities in the 2002 period included net pay downs under our
revolving credit line totaling $4.8 million, issuance of common stock in a
private placement yielding net proceeds of $20.3 million and issuance of
subordinated debentures yielding net proceeds of $4.5 million.

     Management believes, based upon current circumstances, we have adequate
capital resources to support current operating levels for at least the next
twelve months.

Critical accounting policies

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. The following paragraphs include a
discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required. You should also
review Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of significant
accounting policies.

Revenue recognition

We sell products and services to the commercial, government, medical and
educational sectors through a direct sales force of account executives as well
as through resellers. Sales to resellers are made on terms with respect to
pricing, payment and returns that are consistent with those offered to end user
customers. No price protection or similar arrangement is offered, nor are the
obligations as to payment contingent on the resale of the equipment purchased by
the reseller. There are no special rights to return equipment granted to
resellers, nor are we obligated to repurchase reseller inventory.

Product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of video communications
equipment and is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that the price is
fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain, collectibility is
probable and returns are estimable. Revenue is recognized at the time of
shipment since the terms of shipment are FOB shipping point and legal title to
the equipment passes to the customer at this time. Post shipment obligations
such as installation and training are considered relatively insignificant given
the underlying nature of the equipment and of its installation.

Service revenue is derived from services rendered in connection with the sale of
new systems and the maintenance of previously installed systems. Services
rendered in connection with the sale of new systems consist of engineering
services related to system integration, installation, technical training and
user training. Most of these services are rendered at or prior to installation
and all revenue is recognized only after the services have been rendered.
Revenue related to extended service contracts is deferred and recognized over
the life of the extended service period. Revenue related to the Glowpoint
network subscriber service and the multi-point video and audio bridging services
offered by us are recognized through a monthly billing process after services
have been rendered.

                              Long-lived assets

We evaluate impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations, primarily
fixed assets when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
the assets and goodwill might not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating
the recoverability of long-lived assets, the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets would be compared to the carrying amounts of
those assets. If and when the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair
values, the related assets will be written down to fair value.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

In June 2001, the FASB finalized FASB Statements No. 141, "Business
Combinations" (SFAS 141), and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
(SFAS 142). SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and
prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also required that we
recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain
criteria. SFAS 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001 and for purchase business combinations completed on or after July 1, 2001.
The FASB also requires, upon adoption of SFAS 142, that we classify the carrying
amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in SFAS 141.

SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that companies no longer amortize
goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually. In
addition, SFAS 142 requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, reassess the useful lives of
other existing recognized intangible assets, and cease amortization of
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. An intangible asset with an
indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the
guidance in SFAS 142. SFAS 142 is required to be applied in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001 to all goodwill and other intangible assets
recognized at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially
recognized.

A fair value approach was used to test existing goodwill for impairment. The
effective date of the fair value determinations for the impairment of goodwill
was September 30, 2002. The market approach was the method used to determine the
fair value of the video solutions reporting unit. Under this approach, the
quoted market prices in active markets are used as the basis for the measurement
of impairment. The valuation for purposes of measuring impairment indicated by
our stock price was also supplemented by the valuation indicated by a portfolio
of comparable publicly traded companies. The above valuation resulted in an
impairment of $40,012,114 of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 as of
September 30, 2002.

The Company's acquisitions to date have all been accounted for using the
purchase method. All future business combinations will be accounted for under
the purchase method, which may result in the recognition of goodwill and other
intangibles assets, some of which may subsequently be charged to operations,
either by amortization or impairment charges. For purchase business combinations
completed prior to June 30, 2001, the net carrying amount of goodwill was
$2,547,862 as of December 31, 2002. Measurement of impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142 are discussed elsewhere in
this report.

Recent pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board

In July 2002, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for the Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement requires companies
to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities only when
liabilities for those costs are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment
to an exit or disposal plan. FASB No. 146 also requires companies to initially
measure liabilities for exit and disposal activities at their fair values. FASB
No. 146 replaces Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issues No. 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) and EITF No.
88-10, Costs Associated with Lease Modification or Termination. The provisions
of FASB No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. We anticipate the adoption of this statement will not
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure"
("FAS 148"), which (i) amends FAS Statements No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," to provided alternative methods of transition for an
entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation (ii) amends the disclosure provisions of FAS
123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of
an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee
compensation and (iii) amends APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting,"
to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information.
Items (ii) and (iii) of the new requirements in FAS 148 are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have
adopted the increased disclosure requirements of FAS 148 for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2002. We will continue to use the intrinsic value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.

Inflation

Management does not believe inflation had a material adverse effect on the
financial statements for the periods presented.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents
portfolio. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve
principal while maximizing yields. Our cash equivalents portfolio is short-term
in nature, therefore changes in interest rates will not materially impact our
consolidated financial condition. However, such interest rate changes can cause
fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows.

We maintain borrowings under a $15 million working capital credit facility with
an asset based lender that are not subject to material market risk exposure
except for such risks relating to fluctuations in market interest rates. The
carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value since they bear
interest at a floating rate based on the "prime" rate. There are no other
material qualitative or quantitative market risks particular to us.

                                REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and the
Stockholders of Wire One Technologies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wire One
Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wire One
Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

Note 1 -- The Business and Merger with View Tech, Inc.

Wire One Technologies, Inc. ("Wire One" or the "Company") was formed by the
merger of All Communications Corporation ("ACC") and View Tech, Inc. ("VTI") on
May 18, 2000, with the former directors and senior management of ACC succeeding
to the management of Wire One. In connection with the merger, each former
shareholder of ACC received 1.65 shares of Wire One common stock for each share
of ACC common stock held by them. The transaction has been accounted for as a
"reverse acquisition" using the purchase method of accounting. The reverse
acquisition method resulted in ACC being recognized as the acquirer of VTI for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, ACC's historical
results have been carried forward and VTI's operations have been included in the
financial statements commencing on the merger date. Accordingly, all 2000
results through the merger date are those of ACC only. Further, on the date of
the merger, the assets and liabilities of VTI were recorded at their fair
values, with the excess purchase consideration allocated to goodwill.

Wire One is a single source provider of video products and services that assists
customers located principally in the United States with systems design and
engineering, procurement, installation, operation and maintenance of their video
communications systems. The Company offers its customers video communications
products from leading manufacturers such as Polycom (which distributes products
under the Polycom, PictureTel and Accord brands, among others), Tandberg,
RADVision, Cisco Systems and Sony and provide a comprehensive suite of video and
data services including engineering, installation, customized training, on-site
technical assistance and maintenance. The Company also operates its Glowpoint
network subscriber service, which provides its customers with two-way video
communications with high quality of service utilizing an Internet network and
broadband access dedicated solely to transporting video using the H.323 Internet
Protocol standard. Finally, the Company sells multi-point video and audio
bridging services through its Multiview Network Services program. The Company
employs state-of-the-art conferencing servers that provide seamless connectivity
for all switched digital networks. No single customer accounts for more than 10%
of the Company's revenues. Approximately 4% of revenues in 2002 were derived
from customers and U.S. customer affiliates located outside of the United
States. The Company, headquartered in Hillside, New Jersey, operates a
distribution facility in Miamisburg, Ohio and maintains 24 sales offices and
demonstration facilities across the United States. During 2000 and 2001, the
Company did not segregate or manage its operations by business segments. In
2002, the Company managed its operations in two business segments, video
solutions and network solutions.

Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries, AllComm Products Corporation ("APC"), VTC
Resources, Inc. ("VTC") and Wire One Travel Services, Inc. ("WOTS"). All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

   Use of estimates

Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ
from the estimates made. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the
preparation of the financial statements for continued reasonableness.
Appropriate adjustments, if any, to the estimates used are made prospectively
based upon such periodic evaluation. It is reasonably possible that changes may
occur in the near term that would affect management's estimates with respect to
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and inventory reserves.


                                      F-7
                                      <page>
                                       Revenue recognition

The Company sells products and services to the commercial, government, medical
and educational sectors through a direct sales force of account executives as
well as through resellers. Sales to resellers are made on terms with respect to
pricing, payment and returns that are consistent with those offered to end user
customers. No price protection or similar arrangement is offered, nor are the
obligations as to payment contingent on the resale of the equipment purchased by
the reseller. There are no special rights to return equipment granted to
resellers, nor are we obligated to repurchase reseller inventory.

Product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of video communications
equipment and is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that the price is
fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain, collection is
probable and returns are estimable. Revenue is recognized at the time of
shipment because the terms of shipment are FOB shipping point and legal title to
the equipment passes to the customer at this time. Post-shipment obligations,
such as installation and training, are considered relatively insignificant given
the underlying nature of the equipment and of its installation.

Service revenue is derived from services rendered in connection with the sale of
new systems and the maintenance of previously installed systems. Services
rendered in connection with the sale of new systems consist of engineering
services related to system integration, installation, technical training and
user training. Most of these services are rendered at or prior to installation
and all revenue is recognized only after the services have been rendered.
Revenue related to extended service contracts is deferred and recognized over
the life of the extended service period. Revenue related to the Glowpoint
network subscriber service and the multi-point video and audio bridging services
offered by the Company are recognized through a monthly billing process after
services have been rendered.

   Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. During 2001,
$900,000 of the cash and cash equivalents balance was restricted as to its use.
After losing an approximately $745,000 judgment in the Maxbase litigation (note
13), the Company was required to set aside these funds in an interest-bearing
account as it filed its appeal of this judgment. The restrictions on $275,000
were lifted when the Company settled the case and paid $625,000 in early 2002.
The $625,000 had been expensed in previous periods.

   Concentration of credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
and uncollateralized trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and
cash equivalents primarily in commercial checking accounts and money market
funds. Commercial bank balances may from time to time exceed federal insurance
limits; money market funds are uninsured.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. No single
customer accounts for more than 5% of our revenues. The Company records an
allowance for doubtful accounts based on specificially identified amounts that
we believe to be uncollectible. The Company also records additional allowances
based on certain percentages of its aged receivables, which are determined based
on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial conditions
affecting its customer base. If the Company's actual collections experience
changes, revisions to its allowance may be required. After all attempts to
collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the
allowance.

Most of the products sold by the Company are purchased under non-exclusive
dealer agreements with various manufacturers, including Polycom for video
communications equipment. The agreements typically specify, among other things,
sales territories, payment terms and reseller prices. All of the agreements
permit early termination on short notice with or without cause. The termination
of any of the Company's dealer agreements, or their renewal on less favorable
terms than currently in effect, could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's business.

                                       <page>
                                        Inventory

Inventory, consisting of finished goods and spare parts, is valued at the lower
of cost (determined on a first in, first out basis) or market. Reserves are
provided to reflect estimated future requirements and to state these inventories
at the lower of cost or market and are based upon a review of total inventory on
hand.

   Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements

Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Furniture
and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of either the asset's useful life or the related
lease term. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes and on the modified accelerated cost recovery system for
income tax purposes.

   Long-lived assets

The Company evaluates impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations,
primarily fixed assets, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets, might not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets". For
purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets would be compared to the
carrying amounts of those assets. If and when the carrying values of the assets
exceed their fair values, the related assets will be written down to fair value.

   Goodwill and other intangible assets

In June 2001, the FASB finalized FASB Statements No. 141, "Business
Combinations" (SFAS 141), and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
(SFAS 142). SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and
prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also required that we
recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain
criteria. SFAS 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001 and for purchase business combinations completed on or after July 1, 2001.
The FASB also requires, upon adoption of SFAS 142, that we classify the carrying
amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in SFAS 141.

SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that companies no longer amortize
goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually. In
addition, SFAS 142 requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, reassess the useful lives of
other existing recognized intangible assets, and cease amortization of
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. An intangible asset with an
indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the
guidance in SFAS 142. SFAS 142 is required to be applied in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001 to all goodwill and other intangible assets
recognized at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially
recognized.

A fair value approach was used to test existing goodwill for impairment. The
effective date of the fair value determinations for the impairment of goodwill
was September 30, 2002. The market approach was the method used to determine the
fair value of the video solutions reporting unit. Under this approach, the
quoted market prices in active markets are used as the basis for the measurement
of impairment. The valuation for purposes of measuring impairment indicated by
our stock price was also supplemented by the valuation indicated by a portfolio
of comparable publicly traded companies. The above valuation resulted in an
impairment of $40,012,114 of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 as of
September 30, 2002.

The Company's acquisitions to date have all been accounted for using the
purchase method. All future business combinations will be accounted for under
the purchase method, which may result in the recognition of goodwill and other
intangibles assets, some of which may subsequently be charged to operations,
either by amortization or impairment charges. For purchase business combinations
completed prior to June 30, 2001, the net carrying amount of goodwill was
$2,547,862 as of December 31, 2002. Measurement of impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142 are discussed elsewhere in
this report.

   Income taxes

The Company uses the liability method to determine its income tax expense or
benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities (principally certain accrued expenses, compensation expenses,
depreciation expense and allowance for doubtful accounts), and are measured
using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse.

                                         Earnings per share

Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. In determining basic loss per share for the periods presented, the
effects of deemed dividends related to the Company's series A mandatorily
redeemable convertible preferred stock is added to the net loss.

Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus
the weighted average number of net shares that would be issued upon exercise of
stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method and the deemed
conversion of preferred stock using the if-converted method. Diluted loss per
share for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is the same as basic loss per share, since the
effects of the calculation for those years were anti-dilutive.

shares in 2000, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company periodically grants stock options to employees in accordance with
the provisions of its stock option plans, with the exercise price of the stock
options being set at the closing market price of the common stock on the date of
grant. We account for our stock-based compensation plans under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and
accordingly account for employee stock-based compensation utilizing the
intrinsic value method. FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation",
establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation
plans. We have adopted the disclosure only alternative under FAS No. 123, which
requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on earnings and earnings per share
as if FAS No. 123 had been adopted as well as certain other information.

The fair value of stock options or warrants issued in return for services
rendered by any non-employees is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes pricing model and is charged to operations over the vesting period
or the terms of the underlying service agreements. The Company adjusts these
estimates for any increases in market price for each of its reporting periods.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure"
("FAS 148"), which (i) amends FAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," to provide alterative methods of transition for an entity that
voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation (ii) amends the disclosure provisions of, FAS 123 to
require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an
entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee
compensation and (iii) amends APB opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting,"
to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information.
Items (ii) and (iii) of the new requirements in FAS 148 are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have

                                          Recent pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board

In July 2002, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for the Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement requires companies
to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities only when
liabilities for those costs are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment
to an exit or disposal plan. FASB No. 146 also requires companies to initially
measure liabilities for exit and disposal activities at their fair values. FASB
No. 146 replaces Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issues No. 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) and EITF No.
88-10, Costs Associated with Lease Modification or Termination. The provisions
of FASB No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company anticipates the adoption of this statement
will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensus on
Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables include arrangements which provide for
the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use
assets where performance may occur at different points in time or over different
periods of time. The Company generally enters into arrangements for multiple
deliverables that occur at different points in time when it is contracted to
provide installation services. EITF Issue No. 00-21 is effective for the Company
beginning October 1, 2003. The Company has not completed the evaluation of the
impact of this EITF.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure"
("FAS 148"), which (i) amends FAS Statements No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," to provided alternative methods of transition for an
entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation (ii) amends the disclosure provisions of FAS
123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of
an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee
compensation and (iii) amends APB Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting,"
to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information.
Items (ii) and (iii) of the new requirements in FAS 148 are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have
adopted the increased disclosure requirements of FAS 148 for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2002. We will continue to use the intrinsic value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.

The Company is a distributor of videoconferencing equipment manufactured by
others. It does not manufacture any equipment; therefore, it does not have raw
materials or work-in-progress inventories. Its inventory consists of finished
goods purchased from video conferencing equipment manufacturers and spare parts
held to satisfy its obligations under its OneCare service contracts. The cost
of finished goods and spare parts is the purchase price paid to the
manufacturers of the items. As a result, no labor, overhead or general and
administrative costs are included in inventory.

Note 4 -- Discontinued Operations

In March 2003, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities
of its Audio-Visual ("AV") component to Columbia, Maryland-based Signal
Perfection Limited ("SPL") for approximately $807,000, $250,000 of which was
paid in cash at the close of the transaction and the balance of which was paid
in the form of a promissory note payable in five equal consecutive monthly
payments commencing on April 15, 2003. The sale of the AV component was aimed at
enabling the Company to focus more of its resources to the development and
marketing of its subscriber-based IP network, Glowpoint, and to its video
solutions business. As a consequence, this unit has been classified as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements, with its net
assets summarized in a single line item on the consolidated balance sheets and
its results from operations summarized in a single line item on the consolidated
statements of operations.

Net assets of discontinued AV operations consist of the following:

On October 24, 2001, the Company completed the sale of its voice communications
business unit to Fairfield, New Jersey-based Phonextra, Inc. for approximately
$2,017,000, half of which was paid in cash at the close of the transaction and
the balance of which was paid in the form of a promissory note which was paid
in 2002. The Company's sale of its voice communications unit was aimed at
enabling it to sharpen its focus on video solutions and on Glowpoint, its
subscriber-based IP network dedicated to video communications traffic. As a
consequence, this unit has been classified as a discontinued operation in the
accompanying financial statements, with its results from operations summarized
in a single line item on our consolidated statements of operations.

Revenues and pretax income (loss) from Voice division discontinued operations
are as follows:

The pretax loss recorded in 2002 was the result of several post-closing
adjustments related to the settlement of liabilities with vendors and customers
for amounts in excess of those previously accrued.

Note 7 -- Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In June 2001, the FASB finalized FASB Statements No. 141, "Business
Combinations" (SFAS 141), and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
(SFAS 142). SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and
prohibits the use of the pooling-of-interest method of accounting for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also required that we
recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain
criteria. SFAS 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001 and for purchase business combinations completed on or after July 1, 2001.
The FASB also requires, upon adoption of SFAS 142, that we classify the carrying
amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in SFAS 141.

SFAS 142 requires, among other things, that companies no longer amortize
goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually. In
addition, SFAS 142 requires that we identify reporting units for the purposes of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, reassess the useful lives of
other existing recognized intangible assets, and cease amortization of
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. An intangible asset with an
indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the
guidance in SFAS 142. SFAS 142 is required to be applied in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001 to all goodwill and other intangible assets
recognized at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially
recognized.

A fair value approach was used to test existing goodwill for impairment. The
effective date of the fair value determinations for the impairment of goodwill
was September 30, 2002. The market approach was the method used to determine the
fair value of the video solutions reporting unit. Under this approach, the
quoted market prices in active markets are used as the basis for the measurement
of impairment. The valuation for purposes of measuring impairment indicated by
our stock price was also supplemented by the valuation indicated by a portfolio
of comparable publicly traded companies. The above valuation resulted in an
impairment of $40,012,114 of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 as of
September 30, 2002.

The Company's acquisitions to date have all been accounted for using the
purchase method. All future business combinations will be accounted for under
the purchase method, which may result in the recognition of goodwill and other
intangibles assets, some of which may subsequently be charged to operations,
either by amortization or impairment charges. For purchase business combinations
completed prior to June 30, 2001, the net carrying amount of goodwill was
$2,547,862 as of December 31, 2002. Measurement of impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 142 are discussed elsewhere in

Note 9 -- Bank Loan Payable and Long-Term Debt

   Bank loan payable

In June 2000, the Company entered into a $15 million working capital credit
facility with an asset-based lender. Under terms of the two-year agreement for
this facility loan availability was based on up to 75% of eligible accounts
receivable and 50% of inventory, subject to an inventory cap of $5 million.
Borrowings bear interest at the lender's base rate plus 1/2% per annum. In May
2002, the outstanding loan balance was paid off with borrowings under a new
working capital credit facility.

                                      F-13
                                            <page>
                                             In May 2002, the Company entered into a $25 million working capital credit
facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank and incurred $505,074 in deferred financing
costs. Under terms of the three-year agreement for this facility, loan
availability is based on (1) 80% of eligible accounts receivable and (2) the
lesser of 50% against eligible finished goods inventory or 80% against the net
eligible amount of the net orderly liquidation value by category of finished
goods inventory as determined by an outside appraisal firm, subject to an
inventory cap of $2 million. Borrowings bear interest at the lender's base rate
plus 1 1/2 % per annum. At December 31, 2002, the interest rate on the facility
was 5.75%. The credit facility contains certain financial and operational
covenants. For the period from July 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002 (the
"2002 Third Quarter"), the Company was in violation of the covenant requiring
the Company to meet a certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA") target for the three quarters ended September 30, 2002.
In November, 2002, the Company concluded an amendment to the credit facility to
cure noncompliance with the EBITDA covenant. As compensation for this amendment,
the Company granted 100,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.99 to JPMorgan
Chase. The fair value of these warrants was determined to be $176,203 using the
Black-Scholes valuation method and this amount was charged to interest expense
in 2002. For the period from October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 ("2002
Fourth Quarter"), the Company was in violation of the covenant requiring the
Company to meet a certain EBITDA target for the four quarters ended December 31,
2002. In March 2003, the Company concluded an amendment to the credit facility
with JPMorgan Chase Bank to cure non-compliance with the EBITDA financial
covenant arising from the fourth quarter results. Some additional highlights of
the amendment include: 1) a reduction in the commitment amount of the line of
credit from $25 million to $15 million; 2) revised EBITDA covenant levels for
the remainder of the term of the credit agreement; and, 3) maintenance of the
interest rate, loan fees and provisions of the borrowing formula at the same
levels as previously negotiated. At December 31, 2002, $5,845,516 was
outstanding under the facility, and the loan has been classified as non-current
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet because the facility matures on
May 31, 2005.

   Long-term debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:

Note 10 -- Subordinated Debentures

In December 2002, the Company raised net proceeds of $4.6 million in a private
placement of $4,888,000 principal amount of 8% convertible debentures. The
debentures, which are convertible into 2,036,677 shares of common stock at $2.40
per share, are subordinate to the Company's credit facility with JPMorgan Chase
Bank. The debentures mature in February 2004, or 90 days following the
expiration (in May 2005) or earlier termination of the credit facility,
whichever is later. The Company has the option of paying interest on the
debentures in the form of either cash or Wire One common stock. The debentures
will automatically convert into common stock if Wire One shares trade above
$4.80 for 10 consecutive trading days. If the Company elects to prepay the
debentures prior to maturity, the holders may instead elect to convert the
debentures into common stock, in which event the holders will receive, in
addition to the shares issuable upon the conversion, the remaining interest
payable under the debentures through maturity, payable in the form of common
stock based upon the conversion price. Investors in the private placement also
received five-year warrants to purchase 814,668 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $3.25 per share. The warrants are subject to customary
anti-dilution adjustments. The Company also issued to its placement agent
warrants to purchase 40,733 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$0.001 per share with an expiration date of January 31, 2003.

Costs of the offering, including the fair value of the warrants, totaled
$2,519,000. This amount was recorded as a discount on subordinated debentures
and is being amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the August
2005 redemption date. In addition, in accordance with EITF No. 00-27, the
Company recorded additional discount on subordinated debentures of $2,369,000 to
reflect the beneficial conversion feature of the warrants. Accordingly, all of
the proceeds from this financing have been credited to stockholders' equity.

   Initial Public Offering

In May 1997, the Company completed a public offering of 805,000 Units for $7.00
per Unit. Each Unit consisted of two shares of Common Stock and two Redeemable
Class A Warrants. The Warrants are exercisable for four years commencing one
year from the effective date of the offering, at a price of $4.25 per share. The
Company may redeem the Warrants at a price of $.10 per warrant, commencing
eighteen months from the effective date of the offering and continuing for a
four-year period, provided the price of the Company's Common Stock is $10.63 for
at least 20 consecutive trading days prior to issuing a notice of redemption.
The Company received proceeds from the offering of approximately $4,540,000, net
of related costs of registration.

In May 1997, the Company also issued to the underwriter of the public offering,
for nominal consideration, an option to purchase up to 70,000 Units. This option
is exercisable for a four-year period commencing one year from the effective
date of the offering, at a per Unit exercise price of $8.40 per Unit. The Units
are similar to those offered to the public. In March 2000, the Company received
$117,600 from the exercise of 28,000 Units.

On February 10, 2000, the Company announced its intention to redeem all
outstanding Class A warrants. From February through April 2000, the Company
raised net proceeds of approximately $8,047,000 from the exercise of 1,933,647
Class A warrants. All unexercised Class A warrants were redeemed in April 2000,
except for 112,000 Class A warrants underlying the options granted to the
underwriters.

   Common Stock

In August 2001, the Company raised net proceeds of $9.9 million in a private
placement of 2,220,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.00 per share.
Investors in the private placement also received five-year warrants to purchase
814,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.25 per share. The
warrants are subject to certain anti-dilution protection. The Company also
issued to its placement agent five-year warrants to purchase 220,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share.

In January 2002, the Company raised net proceeds of $20.3 million in a private
placement of 3,426,650 shares of its common stock at $6.25 per share. Investors
in the private placement also received five-year warrants to purchase 864,375
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share. The warrants
are subject to certain anti-dilution protection.

   Preferred Stock

In December 1996, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation to authorize the issuance of up to
1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. The authorized number of shares of
Preferred Stock to be issued was raised to 5,000,000 shares effective with the
merger with VTI. Except for the 2,450 shares of Series A preferred stock issued
in June 2000, the rights and privileges of the Preferred Stock have not yet been
designated.

In June 2000, the Company raised gross proceeds of $17.15 million in a private
placement of 2,450 shares of Series A mandatorily redeemable convertible
preferred stock. The preferred shares were convertible into up to 2,450,000
shares of common stock at a price of $7.00 per share, subject to adjustment.
Beginning on June 14, 2001, the preferred stockholders were able to choose an
alternative conversion price which equaled the higher of (i) 70% of the fixed
conversion price then in effect or (ii) the market price on any conversion date,
which was equal to the average of the closing sale prices of the Company's
common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding any
conversion date. Preferred stockholders were able, at their sole option, to have
their shares redeemed on the earlier of three years from the issuance date, or
the occurrence of a triggering event, as defined.

                                               The redemption price was 110% of the stated value of $7,000 per share. None of
the triggering events has occurred to date. Investors in the private placement
also received five-year warrants to purchase a total of 857,500 shares of common
stock for $10.50 per share. The warrants are subject to certain anti-dilution
privileges. The Company has valued the warrants at $3,740,000 using the
Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company also issued to its placement agent
warrants to purchase 193,748 shares of common stock for $7.00 per share, and
warrants to purchase 67,876 shares of common stock for $10.50 per share. The
warrants expire on June 14, 2005. The Company has valued the warrants at
$1,410,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model. At the issuance date, the
Company recorded a deemed dividend and an offsetting increase in additional
paid-in capital of approximately $8.1 million to reflect the beneficial
conversion feature of the preferred stock. During the fourth quarter of 2000, in
accordance with EITF No. 00-27, the Company recorded an additional deemed
dividend of $3.9 million to reflect the beneficial conversion feature of the
warrants.

Costs of the offering, including the fair value of the warrants, totaled
$6,150,000. This amount was recorded as a preferred stock discount and was being
amortized as a deemed dividend over the three-year period from the date of
issuance to the June 2003 redemption date. In addition, the 10% redemption
premium of $1,715,000 was being accreted as a deemed dividend into the carrying
value of the Series A mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock over
the same period.

The stockholders of Wire One Technologies, Inc. were asked, in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 4350(i)(1)(D) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the "Rule"),
and approved, at the 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the issuance by the
Company of more than 20% of its common stock upon the conversion of the
Company's series A preferred and exercise of the related warrants. The Rule
restricted the Company from issuing more 20% of its outstanding shares of common
stock at less than market value in any transaction unless the Company obtained
prior stockholder approval (the "Exchange Cap"). As a consequence of receiving
this approval, the Company was able to issue 3,021,429 shares of its common
stock upon conversion of the remaining 2,115 shares of Series A preferred stock
outstanding when, beginning on June 14, 2001, each remaining holder of Series A
preferred substituted an "alternative conversion price" for the $7.00 fixed
conversion price. The alternative conversion price was equal to 70% of the fixed
conversion price then in effect. Upon conversion of the remaining 2,115 shares
of Series A preferred stock outstanding, the remaining $4,039,940 of un-accreted
discount was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as deemed
dividends on Series A convertible preferred stock.

Note 12 -- Stock Options

   Wire One 2000 Stock Incentive Plan

In September 2000, the Company adopted and approved the Wire One 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "2000 Plan") and reserved up to 3,000,000 shares of Common
Stock for issuance thereunder. In May 2002, the Company's shareholders approved
an amendment to the 1996 Plan increasing the amount of shares available under
the plan to 4,400,000. The 2000 Plan permits the grant of incentive stock
options ("ISOs") to employees or employees of its subsidiaries. Non-qualified
stock options ("NQSOs") may be granted to employees, directors and consultants.
The Company issued 1,640,505 options during 2002 with exercise prices ranging
from $1.00 to $5.48 and vesting periods ranging from one to four years. It had
issued options totaling 2,227,450 and 587,124 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. As
of December 31, 2002, options to purchase a total of 3,743,479 shares were
outstanding and 652,021 shares remained available for future issuance under the
2000 Plan.

The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of options, including ISOs, NQSOs, stock
appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, restricted stock, performance
units, performance shares or any combination thereof (collectively, "Awards").
The exercise price of the Awards is established by the administrator of the plan
and, in the case of ISO's the per share exercise price must be equal to at least
100% of fair market value of a share of the common stock on the date of grant.
The administrator of the plan determines the terms and provisions of each award
granted under the 2000 Plan, including the vesting schedule, repurchase
provisions, rights of first refusal, forfeiture provisions, form of payment,
payment contingencies and satisfaction of any performance criteria. Under the
2000 Plan, no individual will be granted ISO's corresponding to shares with an
aggregate exercise price in excess of $100,000 in any calendar year less the
aggregate exercise price of shares under other Company stock options granted to
that individual that vests in such calendar year. The 2000 Plan will terminate
in 2010.

The Company issued a total of 0, 167,500 and 70,125 options, outside the context
of a stock option plan, during 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively, to various
employees, directors, and advisors, with exercise prices ranging from $1.00 to
$5.48 per share and immediate vesting. At December 31, 2002, the total
outstanding non-qualified options of this nature were 2,054,377. The number of
options has been adjusted to reflect the 1.65 to 1 conversion rate resulting
from the May 18, 2000 merger with VTI.

   1996 Stock Option Plan

In December 1996, the Board of Directors adopted the Company's Stock Option Plan
(the "1996 Plan") and reserved up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance
thereunder. In June 1998, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to
the 1996 Plan increasing the amount of shares available under the plan to
2,475,000. The 1996 Plan provides for the granting of options to officers,
directors, employees and advisors of the Company. The exercise price of
incentive stock options ("ISOs") issued to employees who are less than 10%
stockholders shall not be less than the fair market value of the underlying
shares on the date of grant or not less than 110% of the fair market value of
the shares in the case of an employee who is a 10% stockholder. The exercise
price of restricted stock options shall not be less than the par value of the
shares to which the option relates. Options are not exercisable for a period of
one year from the date of grant. Under the 1996 Plan, no individual will be
granted ISO's corresponding to shares with an aggregate exercise price in excess
of $100,000 in any calendar year less the aggregate exercise price of shares
under other Company stock options granted to that individual that vest in such
calendar year. The 1996 Plan will terminate in 2006. Options granted under the
1996 Plan in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 0, 0 and 334,848 respectively. As of
December 31, 2002, options to purchase a total of 887,963 shares were
outstanding and no shares remained available for future issuance under the 1996
Plan. The number of options has been adjusted to reflect the 1.65 to 1
conversion rate resulting from the merger with VTI.

   VTI Stock Option Plans

As part of the merger with VTI, the Company assumed the outstanding options of
the four stock option plans maintained by VTI. These plans generally require the
exercise price of options to be not less than the estimated fair market value of
the stock at the date of grant. Options vest over a maximum period of four years
and may be exercised in varying amounts over their respective terms. In
accordance with the provisions of such plans, all outstanding options become
immediately exercisable upon a change of control, as defined, of VTI. VTI had
authorized an aggregate of 1,161,000 shares of common stock to be available
under all the current option plans. The plans will terminate in 2009. Options
assumed as part of the merger with VTI totaled 361,605. Options granted under
these Plans in 2002, 2001 and 2000 (since the merger date) were 0, 0 and
189,503, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, options to purchase a total of
323,602 shares were outstanding and no shares remained available for future
issuance. The options have been adjusted to reflect the 2 for 1 reverse stock
split approved by the VTI Board of Directors concurrent with the merger with
ACC.

                                                 The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method of APB Opinion
No. 25 to account for all of its employee stock-based compensation plans.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the accompanying
financial statements for stock options issued to employees because the exercise
price of each option equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying common
stock as of the grant date for each stock option. The weighted-average grant
date fair value of options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 under the
Black-Scholes option pricing model was $1.90, $2.70 and $2.03 per option,
respectively.

The fair value of each option granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:

                                            2002           2001          2000

                                                  Non-cash compensation expense recognized in the Company's Statement of
Operations totaled $675,057, $4,442,316 and $238,865 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a
one-time, non-cash charge of $206,663 related to a one-year extension of certain
stock options originally granted to the Company's COO in 1997 and that were
scheduled to expire in December 2002. The amount of the charge was calculated in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44 "Accounting for Certain Transactions
involving Stock Compensation" which specifies that extending the maximum
contractual life of an award results in a new measurement of compensation cost
at the date of modification and that any intrinsic value at the modification
date in excess of the amount measured at the original measurement date must be
recognized as compensation cost immediately if the award is vested. The
expiration date of the 123,750 fully-vested options with an exercise price of
$0.53 per share was extended for one year on December 9, 2002. The market price
of the Company's common stock on that day was $2.20 per share. In addition to
this charge, the Company recorded a $176,203 non-cash charge to interest expense
for the Black-Scholes value of 100,000 warrants issued to JP Morgan Chase Bank
as compensation for amending its credit agreement. The remaining $292,191 of
non-cash compensation related to amortization of deferred employee stock option
compensation which originated in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Also, during 2002, the Company entered into a severance and consulting
arrangement with the former president of the Company. Under the terms of the
severance arrangement, the Company granted the former president options to
purchase 84,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of
$1.13 per share, which vests 50% upon the date of grant and 50% on July 31,
2003. The Company valued these shares using the Black-Scholes pricing model and
recorded an $86,736 non-cash charge to restructuring for the vested portion of
these shares. Under the terms of the consulting arrangement, the Company granted
an additional 50,000 options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at
an exercise price of $3.00 per share, which vests 5,000 shares per month until
July 31, 2003. The Company also valued these shares using the Black-Scholes
pricing model and recorded a $48,603 non-cash charge to prepaid professional
fees for the vested portion of these shares.

During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a one-time,
non-cash charge of $3,984,750 related to a five-year extension of certain stock
options originally granted to the Company's CEO in 1997 and that were scheduled
to expire in March 2002. The expiration date of the 1,237,500 fully-vested
options with an exercise price of $3.03 per share was extended for five years on
December 26, 2001. The market price of the Company's common stock on that day
was $6.25 per share. In addition to this charge, the Company recorded a charge
of $457,566 of non-cash compensation relating to the amortization of deferred
employee stock option compensation which originated in the fourth quarter of
2000.

During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded $108,863 of
non-cash employee stock option compensation relating to 337,134 stock options
with a three year vesting period granted to employees at an exercise price of
$5.50 per share on September 15, 2000. The market price of the Company's common
stock was $9.38 per share on that day. In addition, $130,002 of compensation
expense was recognized for options granted to non-employees for services
rendered to the Company.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company received
$371,489, $1,589,362 and $674,098, respectively from the exercise of stock
options.

   Legal Matters

In September 1997, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement
with Maxbase, Inc. ("Maxbase"), the manufacturer of "MaxShare 2," a patented
bandwidth-on-demand line-sharing device. The Company identified performance
problems with the MaxShare 2 product in certain applications, and believed that
MaxBase had a contractual obligation to correct any technical defects in the
product.

In July, 1998, MaxBase filed a complaint against the Company alleging that the
Company had failed to meet its required minimum purchase obligations thereunder.
Maxbase claimed damages of approximately $1,350,000 in lost profits, as well as
unspecified punitive and treble damages. The Company filed a number of
counterclaims, which were dismissed by the court.

In February 2001, the court granted Maxbase's motion for summary judgment on
liability for breach of contract, and the plaintiff subsequently dropped all of
its other claims. The court, following a trial to determine damages, entered an
approximately $745,000 judgment in favor of Maxbase. After filing an appeal of
that judgment, the Company determined in December 2001 that it would be able to
settle the case for $625,000, accrued an additional $375,000 in litigation
reserves in 2001 and formally settled the case in early 2002. The additional
litigation reserves were recorded in general and administrative expenses in the
statement of operations.

The Company is defending several other suits or claims in the ordinary course of
business, none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the
Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.

                                                      Note 14 -- Restructuring Charge

During the year ended December 31, 2002, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)," the Company recorded a restructuring charge
of $960,000. The Company recognized this charge in the period in which (a)
management having the appropriate level of authority to involuntarily terminate
employees approved and committed the Company to a plan of termination and
established the benefits that current employees will receive upon termination,
(b) the benefit arrangement was communicated to employees and the communication
of the benefit arrangement included sufficient detail to enable employees to
determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are
terminated, (c) the plan of termination specifically identified the number of
employees to be terminated, their job classifications or functions, and their
locations and (d) the plan of termination indicated that significant changes to
the plan of termination are not likely. The significant components of the
restructuring charge are as follows:

Employee termination costs                                           $500,000
Facility exit costs                                                   460,000
                                                                     --------

The employee termination costs relate to 84 employees and officers of the
Company terminated following the implementation of a cost savings plan. The
facility exit costs relate to the closing or downsizing of 19 sales offices.

                                                        During the 2001 period, management established a valuation allowance to offset
the benefits of significant temporary tax differences due to the uncertainty of
their realization. These deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating
losses carried forward in the VTI merger, reserves and allowances, and stock
based compensation. If the tax benefits currently offset by valuation allowances
are subsequently realized, approximately $7.2 million will be credited to
goodwill because these tax benefits relate to VTI operations prior to the
merger. In addition, approximately $2.8 million will be credited to additional
paid-in capital because these tax benefits relate to the exercise of
non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock
options.

The Company and its subsidiaries file federal returns on a consolidated basis
and separate state tax returns. At December 31, 2002, the Company has net
operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards of approximately $47 million and $39 million
for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal NOL has a
carryover period of 20 years and is available to offset future taxable income,
if any, through 2021. The utilization of the $47 million in tax loss
carryforwards is limited to approximately $2.4 million each year as a result of
an "ownership change" (as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended), which occurred in 2000.

Note 17 -- Pension Plan

On March 1, 1998 the Company adopted a 401(k) Retirement Plan (the "401(k)
Plan") under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan
covered substantially all employees who met minimum age and service
requirements. The 401(k) Plan was non-contributory on the part of the Company.
Effective with the merger with VTI, the Company assumed the 401(k) Plan of VTI,
combined its assets with those of the existing plan and began making
contributions to the plan. Employer contributions to the 401(k) Plan for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $115,000,
$83,000 and $56,000, respectively.

   Merger With View Tech, Inc.

On May 18, 2000 the merger of ACC and VTI was consummated in a transaction that
has been accounted for as a "reverse acquisition" using the purchase method. The
reverse acquisition method resulted in ACC being recognized as the acquirer of
VTI for accounting and financial reporting purposes.

The value of VTI shares exchanged was computed using a five-day average share
price with a midpoint of December 28, 1999, the date of the merger announcement.
The number of shares used in the computation is based on the VTI shares
outstanding as of May 18, 2000.

Following are schedules of the purchase price and purchase price allocation:

solution design and integration of video and audiovisual products into
cost-effective, ergonomic conferencing systems. These solutions were marketed by
AAC to the commercial, medical, distance learning, legal and financial
industries. In exchange for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, Wire
One issued 145,429 shares of its common stock with an assumed value of $5.46 per
share based on the then current market price. On the date of the acquisition,

in annual revenues for AAC. The results of the acquired operations are included

Note 19 -- Related Parties

The landlord for the Company's Hillside, New Jersey office is Vitamin Realty
Associates, L.L.C. of which Eric Friedman, a member of the Company's Board of
Directors until June 2001, is a member. The lease, which was due to expire in

years and expires on April 30, 2005. The current base rental for the premises
during the term of the lease is approximately $162,000 per year. In addition,
the Company must pay its share of the landlord's operating expenses (i.e., those
costs or expenses incurred by the landlord in connection with the ownership,
operation, management, maintenance, repair and replacement of the premises,
including, among other things, the cost of common area electricity, operational
services and real estate taxes). For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, rent expense associated with this lease was $252,000, $295,000 and
$225,000, respectively.

services of approximately $33,000, $105,000 and $99,000, respectively. The
Company also entered into a Consulting Agreement with Mr. Hiltzik, dated January
2, 2001, for the provision of tax and financial services for one year. Mr.
Hiltzik received an immediately vested option to purchase 30,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $3.94 per share pursuant to that agreement.

the terms of a consulting agreement commencing July 22, 2002, through July 31,
2003, Mr. Jaffe provides Company management with assistance in the areas of
corporate development and investor relations. For his services, Mr. Jaffe was
granted an option to purchase 50,000 shares of Wire One common stock at an

In August, 2001, the Company made a loan to Christopher Zigmont, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, in the amount of $210,000 with an 8.25%
rate of interest. The loan was extended to Mr. Zigmont, in connection with his
relocation to the East Coast at the Company's request, to facilitate the

Zigmont was required to repay the loan from proceeds of the sale of his West
Coast home or of any sale of shares acquired by him in connection with his
exercise of any Company stock option, but in no event later than one year after
the loan was made. Mr. Zigmont repaid the loan in full in October 2001.

Note 20 -- Business Segments

The Company follows SFAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of a Business
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as
components of a company about which separate financial information is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and to assess financial performance.

Prior to 2002, the Company was engaged in one business, providing customers with
a single source for video products and services. During fiscal 2002, the
Company's direct investment in the Glowpoint Network has increased and the
financial results of the Network Solutions segment became more material to the
Company so that the Company determined that it was in two reportable segments
for fiscal 2002 and, accordingly reported two operating segments, Video
Solutions and Network Solutions.

Video Solutions Segment

The Video Solutions segment sells and markets a full range of video, audio and
data products and systems from Polycom, Tandberg, VCON Telecommunications, Ltd.
("VCON"), Sony Electronics, Inc., Gentner Communications, Inc. and Extron
Electronics, Inc. principally in the United States. The Company also distributes
data products from companies such as Adtran, Lucent, Initia and RADVision to
provide its customers with remote access into LANs, permitting them to acquire
bandwidth on demand and to digitally transmit data. The Company configures
single- or multi-vendor video and data conferencing platforms for its clients
and integrates systems and components into a complete solution designed to suit
each customer's particular communications requirements. After designing a
customer's video communications solution, it delivers, installs and tests the
communications equipment. When the system is functional, the Company provides
training to all levels of its customers' organizations, including executives,
managers, management information systems and data-processing administrators and
technical staff. Training includes instruction in system operation, as well as
the planning and administration of meetings. By means of thorough training, the
Company helps to ensure that its customers understand the functionality of their
systems and are able to apply the technology effectively. The Company's OneCare
service covers a customer's entire video communications system deployment for a
fixed fee. OneCare encompasses installation and maintenance services that
provide comprehensive customer support after the sale and help ensure that
customers experience reliable, effortless video communications. The Company's
installation service places minimal demands on a customer's time and resources.
The Company's maintenance service provides technical support representatives and
engineers, a help desk offering 24x7 responsiveness, nationwide on-site
diagnostic repair and replacement service, nationwide network trouble
coordination and a video test facility.

Network Solutions Segment

The Network Solutions Segment is composed of the following two components: 1)
Glowpoint network services and 2) Multiview Network Services. The Glowpoint
network provides customers with a high-quality platform for video communications
over IP and related applications. The Glowpoint service offers subscribers
substantially reduced transmission costs and superior video communications
quality, remote management of all videoconferencing endpoints utilizing simple
network management protocol ("SNMP"), gateway services to ISDN-based video
communications equipment, video streaming and store-and-forward applications
from our network operations center ("NOC"). The Company also sells multi-point
video and audio bridging services through its Multiview Network Services
program. The Company employs state-of-the-art conferencing servers that provide
seamless connectivity for all switched digital networks at an affordable rate.

losses on goodwill and other long-lived assets.

Net loss per share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented.
Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net loss per share figures in 2002 and 2001
does not equal the total computed for these years.

Note 22 -- Subsequent Events

In March 2003, the Company concluded an amendment to its existing credit
facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank to cure non-compliance with certain financial
covenants arising from the fourth quarter results. Some additional highlights of
the amendment include: 1) a reduction in the commitment amount of the line of
credit from $25 million to $15 million to bring the commitment amount in line
with Wire One's forecasted need for credit over the balance of the term of the
agreement; 2) revised EBITDA covenant levels for the remainder of the term of
the credit agreement; and, 3) maintenance of the interest rate, loan fees and
provisions of the borrowing formula at the same levels as previously negotiated.

In March 2003, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities
of the Audio-Visual ("AV") component to Columbia, Maryland-based Signal
Perfection Limited ("SPL") for approximately $807,000, $250,000 of which was
paid in cash at the close of the transaction and the balance of which was paid
in the form of a promissory note payable in five equal consecutive monthly
payments commencing on April 15, 2003. The sale of its AV component was aimed at
enabling the Company to focus more of its resources on the development and
marketing of its subscriber-based IP network, Glowpoint, and to its video
solutions business. As a consequence, this unit has been classified as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements, with its net
assets summarized in a single line item on the consolidated balance sheets and
its results from operations summarized in a single line item on the consolidated
statements of operations.

I, Richard Reiss, certify that:

      1.    I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Wire One
            Technologies, Inc.;

      2.    Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any
            untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
            under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
            to the period covered by this annual report;

      3.    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
            information included in this annual report, fairly present in all
            material respects the financial condition, results of operations and
            cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
            in this annual report;

      4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
            establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
            defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the registrant
            and have:

            a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
                  that material information relating to the registrant,
                  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
                  by others within those entities, particularly during the
                  period in which this annual report is being prepared;

            b)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to
                  the filing date of this annual report (the "Evaluation Date");
                  and

            c)    presented in this annual report our conclusions about the
                  effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based
                  on our evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;

      5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed,
            based on our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors
            and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or
            persons performing the equivalent functions):

            a)    all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
                  internal controls which could adversely affect the
                  registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
                  financial data and have identified for the registrant's
                  auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

            b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  registrant's internal controls; and

                                                                         <page>

            this annual report whether there were significant changes in
            internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
            affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our most recent
            evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to
            significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
